wine!"" The woman prepared a strong wine according to his word. That

after he has built the raft, will come. When he comes, you give him
this wine. Then the deluge will begin. He will put all kinds of beings
on the raft. You do not get on it until the water reaches your
knee. Then the water will rise up to the upper edge of the
underpants. Do not put yourself also [on the raft]. Then it will rise
up to your breast. Then your man will say to you: 'Sit down, you
devil!' When he says this, he summons me. Then we board the raft!"" That woman put the devil under the leather which was spread out
under her. Then her husband came. She gave him strong wine. Then said
the old man: ""Bah devil, what sweet wine! Why did you not bring it
earlier?"" First he resisted long and did not want to drink the

downpour of the water, all the birds, so many, existing and [now]

down on the mammoth. The wings of the eagle were also tired, and he

God determined to destroy the sinners, but in mercy he instructed Noah to warn them of the threat of a flood and to preach to them to mend their ways. Noah did this for 120 years. God gave mankind a final week of grace during which the sun reversed course, but the wicked men did not repent; they only mocked Noah for building the ark. Noah learned how to make the ark from a book, given to Adam by the angel Raziel, which contained all knowledge. This book was made of sapphires, and Noah put it in a golden casket and, during the flood, used it to tell day from night, for the sun and moon did not shine at that time. The flood was caused by male waters from the sky meeting the female waters from the ground. God made holes in the sky for the waters to issue from by removing two stars from the Pleiades. He later closed the hole by borrowing two stars from the Bear. That is why the Bear always runs after the Pleiades. The animals came to the ark in such numbers that Noah could not take them all; he had them sit by the door of the ark, and he took in the animals which lay down at the door. 365 species of reptiles and 32 species of bird were taken. Since seven pairs of each kind of clean animal were taken, the clean animals outnumbered the unclean after the flood. One creature, the reem was so big it had to be tethered outside the ark and follow behind. The giant Og, king of Bashan, was also too big and escaped the flood sitting atop the ark.

The ark, and the animals in it, were tossed around on the waters for a year, but Noah's greatest difficulty was feeding all the animals, for he had to work day and night to feed both the diurnal and nocturnal animals. When Noah once tarried in feeding the lion, the lion gave him a blow which made him lame for the rest of his life and prevented him from serving as a priest. On the tenth day of the month of Tammuz, Noah sent forth a raven, but the raven found a corpse to devour and did not return.

For a month, it continued to fall, day and night, without letup. The rivers overflowed their banks and covered everything. Only one woman, observing the increasing waters, had the presence of mind to improvise a raft. This woman was named Nete. She got onto a large fallen tree, stowed some provisions as best she could among its roots, and let the current carry her where it would. Another man named Rokawan also was struggling to survive. He climbed the tallest tree in the land. As the waters rose higher, he climbed higher, until he reached the highest branch that could support his weight. The water kept rising until only his forearms and face were exposed; his mouth, nose, and eyes were fringed by the foam of the flood. He had resigned himself to being drowned when suddenly, inexplicably, the waters started to lower. Rokawan's life was saved, but he was forever changed. He turned into a Saki monkey (Pithesia monachus), which still has whitish forearms and a white line about its face from the foam. Meanwhile, Nete rode on her raft, floating on waters that went all directions. Finally the raft came aground at an unknown spot. A great many bees and wasps flew around. Nete realized the magnitude of her misfortune and began crying. She continued crying day and night. One day Nete found four gourds. She cut off the top of one, emptied it of its pulp, and filled it with her tears, mucus, and saliva. When it was full, she caught a large black bee and shut it inside the gourd, too. She did the same with the four other gourds, putting a brown wasp in the second gourd, a tiny bee in the third, and a much larger wasp in the fourth. Scarcely had she finished filling them all than the first gourd burst, revealing a baby boy. Nete named it Inobake. Soon the second gourd burst, giving a baby girl whom Nete named Banobake. Finally from the third and fourth gourds came, respectively, a girl and a boy, named Inanibake and Roabake. All of the children grew at an amazing rate, and soon they were adolescents. Nevertheless, Nete had become blind from all her crying. Thereafter she took the name Netebuekon, or Blind Nete. One day Nete told her children that she wanted to look for her brother. Her children supported and guided her as they went upriver. Along the way, the children brought her leaves of banana, yuca, papaya, sweet potato, corn, and other plants, and Nete named the plants for them and explained how to cultivate and cook them. The children gathered seeds and shoots from the plants as they went. They came to one place where there were many huge bones in the ground. Netebuekon began to cry and explained that they are the bones of her ancestors. (Actually they are fossils from the Tertiary and Quaternary, which may still be seen not far from today's Cashinahua. )Finally they came to the place where Netebuekon used to live. There she told her children how to build a house and start a farm, and they settled. Inobake took Banobake as a wife, and Roabake married Inanibake. Netebuekon's brother, Nawapaketawan, was still alive. Long before the deluge, he had been attracted by lust to his sister, who was already married. Nevertheless, he ran off with her and had married her. To escape pursuit, they had climbed to the top of a high cliff above a ravine, and we suppose that the flood did not reach them there. Netebuekon said one day that the time to visit him had come. ""I can hear him chopping firewood every morning. Let's go. ""But when they reached the brother, Nawapaketawan was not happy to have visitors. In a fury, he armed himself with a club and bow, and only with difficulty did his wife dissuade him from attacking. Still, his anger was not diminished, and he told Netebuekon, ""In three days you shall die!"" He beat on his temple with his hand until he opened a wound which, surprisingly, did not bleed, and then he took to his hammock and did not stir from it for three days. Netebuekon and her children camped as far away from Nawapaketawan as they could. Nevertheless, when Nawapaketawan got up after three days, Netebuekon was dead. Her children decided to take revenge. The eldest, Inobake, took a small play-arrow and poisoned its tip. Then he gave it to the youngest daughter, Inanibake, with instructions to shoot him in the testicles with it. She pretended to play with her little bow and arrows until she neared her uncle. Nawapaketawan had huge testicles which drug on the ground behind him, and it was easy for Inanibake to shoot them with the poisoned arrow. Nawapaketawan, thinking he had been stung by an insect, went to lie down and died soon after. Since then, Netebuekon's children lived in peace and grew in number, up to today.","One day, the rain began to fall. For a month, it continued to
fall, day and night, without letup. The rivers overflowed their banks
and covered everything. Only one woman, observing the increasing
waters, had the presence of mind to improvise a raft. This woman was
named Nete. She got onto a large fallen tree, stowed some provisions
as best she could among its roots, and let the current carry her where
it would.Another man named Rokawan also was struggling to survive. He
climbed the tallest tree in the land. As the waters rose higher, he
climbed higher, until he reached the highest branch that could support
his weight. The water kept rising until only his forearms and face
were exposed; his mouth, nose, and eyes were fringed by the foam of
the flood. He had resigned himself to being drowned when suddenly,
inexplicably, the waters started to lower. Rokawan's life was saved,
but he was forever changed. He turned into a Saki monkey (Pithesia
monachus), which still has whitish forearms and a white line about
its face from the foam.Meanwhile, Nete rode on her raft, floating on waters that went all
directions. Finally the raft came aground at an unknown spot. A
great many bees and wasps flew around. Nete realized the magnitude of
her misfortune and began crying. She continued crying day and
night.One day Nete found four gourds. She cut off the top of one,
emptied it of its pulp, and filled it with her tears, mucus, and
saliva. When it was full, she caught a large black bee and shut it
inside the gourd, too. She did the same with the four other gourds,
putting a brown wasp in the second gourd, a tiny bee in the third, and
a much larger wasp in the fourth.Scarcely had she finished filling them all than the first gourd
burst, revealing a baby boy. Nete named it Inobake. Soon the second
gourd burst, giving a baby girl whom Nete named Banobake. Finally
from the third and fourth gourds came, respectively, a girl and a boy,
named Inanibake and Roabake. All of the children grew at an amazing
rate, and soon they were adolescents.Nevertheless, Nete had become blind from all her crying.
Thereafter she took the name Netebuekon, or Blind Nete.One day Nete told her children that she wanted to look for her
brother. Her children supported and guided her as they went upriver.
Along the way, the children brought her leaves of banana, yuca,
papaya, sweet potato, corn, and other plants, and Nete named the
plants for them and explained how to cultivate and cook them. The
children gathered seeds and shoots from the plants as they went.They came to one place where there were many huge bones in the
ground. Netebuekon began to cry and explained that they are the bones

Some people went fishing with huaca (a poison made from Clibadium remotiflorum), but there were no fish in the lagoon. Our God, Kuánra, sent his son, Kuánra Kájlaui, who began spearing fish. Evil people saw him catching the fish, and they dug a hole and buried him. But there were good people nearby who dug him from the hole and cleaned him off. To thank them, Kuánra Kájlaui speared some tiny fish, which he filled with water and turned into doradas (Elisha deauratus), doncella (unidentified), tucanaré (Cichla ocellaris), and other large fish (which is why there are large fish in the lagoon today). ""Quickly go and cook these fish,"" he told the good people. ""My father is going to avenge me and send a tremendous storm. Hurry and cook and eat the fish. ""One of the good men told his family to quickly cook the fish, and then they ate them. Then he was told to climb a cudí tree (Erythrina elei). The family climbed to a high branch, but the man's pregnant wife was turned into a termite nest and remained stuck halfway up. Then the rains came, and it became dark as night. The evil people were all drowned. Those in the tree, by feeling around in the dark, found a variety of foods and so survived for more than a month while the flood remained. They dropped the tree's fruits to test by the sound of their falling whether the flood had receded yet. Gradually, the waters lowered and the light increased. The man sent his son down to see if the land was drying. The son yelled, ""Yes, the flood is receding,"" and he was transformed into a white heron (Egretta alba). His other son, upon being sent down, turned into another bird, a coro coro (Caracara plancus) and flew off. Then the father himself had to climb down. There was no forest or overgrowth left, just a giant beach. The man walked along it for some time and came to a small shelter stocked with all sorts of foods. Curious who had prepared it, he dug a hole in the beach, hid in it, and waited. A small, wonderfully crafted canoe came down from the sky. In the stern was Kana Nebá, ""our goddess. "" Next to her was a woman wearing a garment of palm-fiber cloth. In the bow was a servant woman who did not know how to weave such cloth. In fact, she could do nothing; she was worthless. The man came out of hiding and grabbed the servant woman. She rebuffed him, saying, ""Take the other woman, wrapped in palm-fiber cloth. It is she who Kana Nebá sent to be your wife,"" but the man kept hold of her. A pit viper (Bothrops pictus), a spider, and a large ant (Myrmica saevissima) were sent to bite him, but still he grasped the servant woman. ""Kana Nebá sent me to be your servant, but you are determined to take me and not the other woman who knows how to do everything. So be it. "" From that time on there have always been ignorant, useless people who do not even know how to make palm-fiber cloth. As Kana Nebá left, the wise woman turned into a bird and flew off. The other woman stayed and married the man. The man's new wife told him that they should have children without sex, but just by embracing. While the man was away hunting, the woman rolled up a ball of cotton. When the man returned, it was a child, and it greeted the man as its father. The man wondered how it was made, so next time he stayed near, hid, and watched. When he saw the woman create a child from cotton and place it in a hole, he came out of hiding and said, ""That is not my child. "" The child began crying. The woman explained that those who do not abstain from sex for ten months make their children sick. But the man had sex anyway, and the child became ill. That is why we abstain from sex for ten months after birth, lest the children become ill or lame.","They say we are descended from just one person. . . .Some people went fishing with huaca (a poison made

They stay on this side of the door, in the land of night.","In the beginning, the stars were people and lived on earth. Their
village was Shiricheña, at the foot of Kushamakari; it was full
of powerful and learned people. But one day, when they were out
hunting, they listened to Jaguar and killed and ate a woman. That is
why they were punished.Kuamachi went on the path to Shiricheña. He thought, ""There
are many of them, and they are powerful. How will I kill them?"" He
had a basket of dewaka fruit. ""I'll invite them to pick
fruit.""He went into Shiricheña. Wlaha, its chief, asked, ""What are
you doing here?""""I have come from the house of my grandfather, Mahanama. Our trees
are full of fruit, and there are just two of us. I have come to ask
for help to harvest it. Then we will divide it.""Wlaha went to talk it over with the elders. They said, ""We don't
trust Mahanama. We killed his daughter. Let's not go."" Wlaha went
back and told Kuamachi they were not going.""Too bad,"" he said, eating a dewaka. ""They are good, and
there are lots of them. Try one. Here's more for your people to
try.""Wlaha called the people. ""Mmmmm, that's good,"" said one.
""Delicious,"" said another. They discussed it again. Kuamachi
waited.Wlaha went back to Kuamachi. ""I'm leaving now,"" Kuamachi said, but
he was just saying it; he did not go.""""Wait,"" said Wlaha, ""We'll go with you.""Kuamachi led the Star People to the trees, getting Mahanama on the
way. The Stars climbed up into the trees and began eating.Mahanama said, ""I'm going to start weaving baskets for the
harvest."" The Star People just laughed at that; they were just eating
the fruit, not gathering it.Kuamachi climbed up a tree, picked a fruit, and dropped it. When
it broke, water came out. It flooded the forest. Kuamachi thought,
""Canoe,"" and there was a canoe. Mahanama jumped in it with his
baskets.Now Mahanama started throwing baskets into the water. One turned
into an anaconda, another into a crocodile, another into a piranha.
The water filled with deadly animals.The men above, watching, became frightened. ""Why are throwing away
the baskets?"" Wlaha said, ""we are collecting to fill them."" Now
Mahanama and Kuamachi laughed.Kuamachi set a termite nest on fire, and the forest filled with
smoke. The boy jumped into the canoe, and they paddled off to get
bows and arrows which he had hidden in a cave. When they returned,
they could see nothing for the smoke. They just heard the people in
the trees coughing and choking.When the smoke cleared, they saw the people crying and begging for
mercy. Kuamachi shot an arrow. A man dropped into the water.
Animals devoured him. Wlaha hid among the branches. Kuamachi shot
and shot, and people fell. The animals came up looking for food.
The mawadi swallowed people in one gulp. Everything was red
with blood.Kuamachi ran out of arrows as the sun was setting. There were
seven men left in the trees. They were Wlaha, who had turned himself
into seven. They were holding seven arrows, which they had gathered
from the ones Kuamachi shot.Wlaha called his men. Many were dead, but those who were still
alive climbed out of the water. First came a man carrying his leg,
which the creatures had cut off but not eaten. He was called Ihette,
One Leg. Many others climbed up after him and gathered in the trees
again.The seven Wlaha aimed their arrows at the sky. ""We're going to
leave this hell-hole,"" he said. ""We'll shoot the arrows and make a
ladder to the heavens. Who wants to go first and tie the rungs
together?""Wlaha looked at a man in front of him, but that man shook with
fear. ""Not me,"" he said, ""I'll fall."" Wlaha turned him into a bird.
The bird called ""Watte! Watte! I'll fall! I'll fall!""""You're a coward,"" Wlaha said. ""You can stay here with the
animals. Your grandchildren will call just like you.""Another man named Ahishama volunteered to go. Wlaha turned him
into a bird with beautiful bright orange feathers, the troupial
(Icterus icterus). Another man said he could go. Wlaha turned
him into a frog. They called him Kütto.Wlaha shot an arrow. Troupial flew up carrying the end of
a sahudiwa vine (Schnella bicomata). Frog leapt,
carrying a little peraman gourd (Symphonia globulifera).
Ahishama caught the arrow and tied it down, and Frog glued it
with peraman.The seven Wlaha shot their arrows, which became rungs in a ladder
to Heaven. Ahishama and Kütto were the first ones up.
Immediately they began shining. Ahishama became Mars. Wlaha went up
next, calling for the others to follow. He became seven men staying
close to each other, the Pleiades. Wlaha's son went up and turned
into three stars. Mönettä, the scorpion turned into the Big
Dipper. Ihette went up, carrying his leg (Orion's belt).
Amaduwakadi, the Morning Star, went up. Many others went up.Kuamachi watched them and wanted to go, too. He started up.
Ioroko was ahead of him, carrying a basket full of poison. Kuamachi
though, ""He's a demon; he doesn't belong in Heaven."" Aloud, he said,
""I'm going light, and you're loaded down. Let me go ahead of you.""
Ioroko let him pass, and Kuamachi hurried to the top. Then he called
Wadakame, the crab, to cut the vine. Crab could not do it, so Kahshe,
the piranha, was called, who cut it right away. The ladder fell.
Ioroko fell and sank in the water.Kuamachi had brought Akuaniye, the Peace Plant, with him, and he
offered it to Wlaha. ""Okay,"" said Wlaha, ""the fighting is over.""Kuamachi found a house on the horizon and does not wander far from
it. He is the Evening Star.The old ones say the Stars thought they had arrived in Heaven, but

After a day's walk, reaching the foot of a mountain, they made camp. They hunted the next day and brought back many birds, which they smoked on a fire. They hunted again the next day, but when they returned, their previous day's game had disappeared. The third day, they decided that one should stay, while the others hunt, to see what happens. The one who stayed heard a huge hollow tree resound. A snake, the pangui, came out and swallowed all the game. When the others came back, the man told what he had seen.

"" Soon after the daughter left, however, the child began to cry, and no matter how much his grandmother rocked him in the hammock, he would not stop. Then she took him out, put him on her knees, and started undressing him, when suddenly the child turned into a snake and escaped from her arms. When the young woman returned and saw the hammock empty, she asked the grandmother what had happened, and learning the truth, replied only, ""So if such it was, such it is. "" She went to her bedroom and crossed opposite her door, and then water flowed from every part of the house and formed a pond. Much later, the people wanted to drain this lake, and so they opened a gully to it, but the escaping water killed many workers with its violence. With the pond almost dry, they found a fern which, on being pricked, oozed blood, by which sign they believed that the mother of the child was a snake. The waters which left formed another pond in the community of the little town of Ovejas. That is why it blows cold there.

mother with her daughter. The mother never allowed the daughter to
work outside alone; she did not want her to know the love of a man or
have a family. That is why she made the daughter sleep in a bedroom
which was reached only by passing through three doors securely locked
with three keys.One night, curious men watching the house saw a cat enter the
bedroom of the girl. However, it was not a cat, but a snake which
appeared to the men in that form.Some time later, the daughter gave birth to a child, but she never

Sekéi and circled down to land at the edge of the plantation of
the giant armadillo Mauraíme. Mauraíme's daughter was
there. Wazamaíme started singing, and the daughter said,

cage for him and took him to hang by her hammock. Every night she
dreamt that he was a beautiful young man. One day she said to the
bird, ""Turn into a man and marry me."" That night he did.He remained in the house of Mauraíme for three days. One
day Wazamaíme's wife wanted to go to the top of Petouitepe, a
steep mountain. ""How can I climb there"", Wazamaíme asked?""Grasp my hair. I'll take you with me."" Then he held her long
hair, and they went under the ground and arrived at the summit.Later Mauraíme told Wazamaíme that he should visit
his relatives, who were drinking kaschiri. ""But don't speak of me to

From the King of the Vultures, he borrowed clothes so that he could go down to earth. Each day he went down, he ate dead animals, so now he was a vulture. One day Nyíueldue, a great Mama, caught Diginavi in a trap. He took the bird home for its beautiful white feathers, and he fed it so that the feathers would grow. His daughter cared for it. Nyíueldue once saw his daughter leaving the house with a man, and he deduced that the man was the bird. He made a separate house for them and burnt it with the two of them inside. But Duginávi shielded them from the heat with his wings (which is why vulture wings are black now). They left, hidden by smoke. Some time later, Nyíueldue suffered famine and, searching elsewhere for food, came to Duginávi's field. Nyíueldue did not recognize Duginávi, having seen him well only as a bird, but Duginávi recognized Nyíueldue and burned him one day by setting fire to the field he was in. The king of the vulture rescued him, but Nyíueldue was later killed by his son because he replanted at night the forest that the son had cleared the previous day. Duginávi became old and started making masks instead of working in the field. His wife became angry at him, killed their daughter, cooked her in a great pot, and left. When Duginávi discovered this, he put on the mask of Rain, called a heavy shower, and threw himself into the swollen river, hoping to die. But the river did not want to kill him; she carried him to the sea, where he was swallowed by a great animal. Inside were other things which had been swallowed -- firewood, food, and other people. Duginávi made fire for cooking, which caused the animal (Mevankukue) pain. In time, the animal grew weak and vomited Duginávi onto the shore. Duginávi next encountered some bad cannibal women, whom he ran from, eventually coming to the Thunder People, whom he lived and worked with. The Thunder People could fell a whole mountainside in one day, while Duginávi felled only a few trees. He went to the Mother, who told him the secret (measure the forest, stick the knife and axe in a tree, and sleep), and he cleared even more forest than the Thunder People.

He stole their drums in retribution, but the found out and forced him to give them back.

The human survival story almost certainly comes mostly from Europe. The Sun's bride was the gooddess of the waves, and their son, Vagoniona, became father of all mankind. The Earth had come from another world, in the clouds of a far-off sky, created by Yocaunagua-Maonocon. When she was still young, the Earth began to play with the Waters. The Waters, much older than the Earth, thought the Earth was becoming too bold. The Earth shook her green crown above them; she nourished the people that Vagoniona now let into the light; and she boasted of being the Mother of Nature. When the Waters began to roil with fury, the Earth laughed innocently and tossed their waves back off of her rocks. The Waters appealed to the evil spirit Mabuya to allow them to punish the Earth.

He learned an incantation to the Duende, a powerful being who, if in good humor and for a good cause, can grant any wish. On that particular moonless night, the Duende must have been in a particularly good humor, for he immediately granted enough money for the young man to build a large castle. The young man selected a site on a hill, and as the castle's foundations were being laid, he swelled with pleasure at the prospect of welcoming the town to his castle, but as time went on, he became more reluctant to share a rich home, and he grew more and more to dislike his fellow men. When the last stone of the castle was laid, he lived entirely alone. One rainy night, an old stranger knocked at his bolted door and asked for hospitality. The owner of the castle brusquely told him to be gone and would not listen to the stranger's further entreaties. Seeing that the old man tarried, the castle owner said, ""I wish the road to this castle would go, so that no man could find a way to my door. ""The old man, who was Duende himself, walked away and caused the castle slowly to sink into the ground, until it disappeared entirely. But the people of Tzalamha know that it was once there, for sometimes, as they walk at the foot of the hill, they can hear the castle owner begging piteously for someone to come visit him. The people also know that Duende set a great horned serpent to guard the sunken castle, and if anyone digs in the hill, it will come from the ground into the river, causing the river to flood the town, and those who are not drowned will die of pestilence.","Once, long ago, in the town of Tzalamha, there lived a poor young

night, the Duende must have been in a particularly good humor, for he

foundations were being laid, he swelled with pleasure at the prospect

asked for hospitality. The owner of the castle brusquely told him to
be gone and would not listen to the stranger's further entreaties.

channelling the water into five separate seas. With the aid of the
earth Mother (Taté Yulianáka), trees and grass sprang
up. Nakawé became wind.The man and the bitch lived in a cave. He went back to work
clearing a field while the bitch stayed home. Every afternoon on
coming back, he found corncakes prepared for him. He was curious to
know who made them, and after five days he hid in the bushes near the
cave to watch. He saw the bitch take off her skin and hang it up,
becoming a woman who then began grinding corn. Coming up quietly
behind her, he grabbed the skin and threw it in the fire. ""Now you
have burned my tunic,"" she cried, and she began to whine like a dog.
He bathed her with water mixed with ground corn, and she felt
refreshed and remained a woman from then on. They had a large family,
and the sons and daughters married and repeopled the earth.When the man went to plant corn, he thrust a pointed stick into the
ground, making a hole in which he dropped a few grains. But nothing
sprang forth except stones, because he planted corn as the Mexicans
do. Then he asked the Mother Above for a planting stick, and now the
corn grew well, as did beans and squashes. He planted the first year
in the south, the second in the north, the third in the west, the
fourth in the east, and the fifth here in Toapúli.","The Huichols have sometimes made models of the flood ark and sacrificed them for the purpose of causing rain.

The son of another wise man stayed with her but did not bring her home. However, she had a baby, and he took it with him. When he reached his village, he left the baby over the hill; then he went and told his father about the girl and the baby. His father told him to go back and bring the baby. The young man went back and found the baby crying. He thought, though, that if his wife did not like him enough to go with him, he would not bring the baby home, and he left it there. Upon returning home, his father again sent him back. When he got back to the baby, he saw that the earth all around it was wet from its tears. Again, though, he could not pick it up and returned home. His father sent him back a third time, and he saw a stream of water running from where the baby was. The fourth time he went back, he saw water coming up all around the baby. The father, when he heard of this, began to prepare. He said that there would be a flood covering the whole earth. He told others, and they began to call upon Older-Brother to save them. Older-Brother made a pot out of grease-wood for himself. Seeing it, Coyote made another like it for himself. When Humming-Bird asked what to do, Older-Brother told him to fly up and hang on the heavens. Woodpecker hung there too, and began to cry when the water reached his tail, but Humming-Bird assured him that Older-Brother said they would be all right. Coyote and Older-Brother had agreed that which of them was to be considered the elder should be determined by which came out of their vessel first. After the water went down, Older-Brother came out first. Coyote wandered around after he came out and when he finally met Older-Brother, claimed to have come out first, but of course Older-Brother did not believe him.

harshly to the Creator, and the Creator feared him. Elder Brother
shortened people's lives so that they didn't multiply out of control
as before. He resolved further to destroy mankind entirely with a
great flood. He created a handsome youth to go among the Pimas, wed
their women, and beget children, staying with each wife only until his
first child was born. The first wife gave birth four months after
marriage and conception, and the gestation periods became shorter with
each successive wife, until the last child was born at the time of the

time when there was nothing to eat, so the hummingbird was sent to see
what he could find. Flying up into the sky, he found a grape vine
which grew through a hole into the upper world. He flew through the
hold and found a land where mescal and fruits and flowers of all kind
were plentiful. The hummingbird flew back and told the people of the
beautiful country above, and the people all went up, climbing the
grape vine. But they left behind them in the underworld the
frog-folk, who were blind.When the people had lived in that land for a while, they heard a
noise come from the hole. A man looked down and saw water rising; it
already nearly reached the mouth of the hole. The people said, ""The
blind frogs have made this flood. If it keeps rising it will wash us
all away."" They decided to hollow out a tree like a trough, into

Then a thin circular disc, no larger than a hand, yellow on one side and white on the other, appeared in midair. On the disc sat a bearded man little larger than a frog. This was Kuterastan, The One Who Lives Above, who had the task of creating all things. Kuterastan created light. Then to help him he created Stenatlihan, Woman Without Parents; Chuganaai, the Sun; and Hadintin Skhin, a small boy. He next created Tarantula, the Big Dipper, the Wind, Lightning Maker, and Lightning Rumbler. Together they created Nigostun, the Earth, which at first was just a smooth, treeless, reddish-brown plain. Datilye, the Hummingbird, was created to examine the earth. After circling it, he reported that the earth was very smooth and beautiful, with water on the western side. But the earth kept shifting and rolling, so Kuterastan made four great posts -- colored black, blue, yellow, and white -- to support it. As Stenatlihan sang, Nilchidilhkizn, the Wind, dashed to the cardinal points with the posts and placed them under the sides of the earth, and the world then sat still. Feeling that there ought to be a sky, Kuterastan began another song. After chanting it four time, there appeared twenty-eight men and women to help make a sky. He chanted another song to create chiefs for the sky and the earth. Ndidilhkizn, the Lightning Maker, circled the world and returned with three people. Though they had head, arms and legs, they had no eyes, ears, hair, mouth, nose, fingers, or toes. Chuganaai sent for Doh, the Fly, to erect a sweathouse. The three newcomers and five others entered it. They sang their songs as the sweat began. When they were finished, Kuterastan and Stenatlihan placed them on a blanket and made their fingers, toes, etc. These three became Sky Boy, chief of the sky, Earth Daughter, in charge of earth and its crops, and Pollen Girl, in care of the health of earth's people. Kuterastan made a few animals, birds, trees, and a hill to relieve the earth's barren flatness. Then he sent Agocho, the pigeon, to see how it looked. Four days later Agocho returned and said all was beautiful, but in four days more the water in the west would rise and flood the land. Kuterastan at once created a piñon tree. Stenatlihan tended it so that it grew to enormous size. With four great limbs as a framework, she made a very large water jar, covering it with gum from the piñon. When the water appeared as predicted, Kuterastan went up on a cloud, taking his twenty-eight helpers with him, while Stenatlihan summoned the others into the jar, closing its mouth when they were all in. The flood completely submerged the earth for twelve days. Then the waters subsided, leaving the jar on the summit of the hill Kuterastan had made. The waters had changed the smooth plain into a series of mountains, hills, rivers, and valleys. The Turkey and Crow were the first to tour the land. At the base of the hill, the Turkey got the tips of his tail feathers dipped in a small alkaline creek, and they have been white ever since. They reported that everything looked beautiful as far as they went. Stenatlihan then sent the Pigeon to make a complete circuit, and he reported that the beautiful landscape extended in all directions. Kuterastan and his helpers had completed the sky during the flood. Kuterastan then summoned his people to the valley below the hill, where he told them he was going to leave them. He charged Sky Boy, Earth Daughter, and Pollen Girl to care for the sky, earth, and people, Lightning Rumbler to have charge over the clouds and water, and Stenatlihan to have overall charge. Kuterastan and Stenatlihan rubbed their hands on their thighs and then cast their hands downward, and a great pile of wood appeared. They set it afire, and Kuterastan disappeared into the clouds of white billowy smoke. The other gods and goddesses followed, leaving the twenty-eight who had helped build the sky to people the earth. Chuganaai went east to travel with the sun; Stenatlihan made her home in the west. Hadintin Skhin and Pollen Girl sought homes among the clouds in the south, and the Big Dipper may still be seen in the north.","There was a time when nothing existed -- no earth, no sky, no sun

The flood which results from stealing the water monster's children is common but differs in details between versions. The original of this account does not identify all the named characters. Hostjaishjini is a fire god. Nastjeasun, presumably, is another god; the name suggests ""Owl woman. "" Tulthklahale is apparently the same as the crane Teklaliale. The first world was barren ground. Etséhostin and Etséasun, Old Man and Old Woman, existed there, and on the fourth day they began to think of eating. Hostjaishjiné rubbed some skin from his belly and laid it on the ground. The woman [Nastjeasun?] did the same. Etséhostin formed two rolls of skin from his back and laid them on the ground. From this arose a man with a mask, the first human. Etséasun created a woman called Josdelhashi from her skin. Etséhostin similarly created Teholtsody, a water monster, and Usheenasun, Salt Spirit. Hostin (Old Man) created a wing from a bit of his tongue. When he placed this on his ear, the wind would shake it and tell him everything. He also created a large frog, Tlalc, and a crane, Teklaliale. Etséasun created Thunder from her scalp skin and a feather. This makes twelve personages up to this time. Etséhostin asked Hostjaishjiné how to get food. Hostjaishjiné, who always looks angry, said, ""I do not know,"" but he created Wunustcinde, Cicada, from some skin on his neck. Etséasun asked Nastjeasun how to get food, and she created Nazozi, Ant, from which many little yellow ants came after four days. Hostjaishjiné created a horned toad, Nashongbitcijy. Etséhostin built a house there, but the ants annoyed people so that they could find no rest. Teholtsody traveled east, and as the world was very small then, he soon came to its limit and built his house there. In like manner, the frog traveled south, Salt Woman went west, and Tulthklahale went north, and each built a house. Etséhostin said, ""I wish we could get some clouds for rain,"" and he looked east and saw many clouds, for Teholtsody's house is of clouds. Etséasun said, ""I wish we had rain"" and saw in the south a heavy fog which was frog's house. Etséhostin prayed for rain and saw a mirage in the west. Etséasun prayed for rain and saw in the north a green water scum from which a house was made. Etséhostin sent Thunder naked to stand in the doorway of Teholtsody's house in the east. Teholtsody gave him a mantle and headdress of feathers which were lightning. Etséhostin and Etséasun sent other beings to stand in the doorways of the others' houses. Teholtsody had made a water vessel of white clay. Frog made one of blue clay. Usheenasun made one of yellow clay. Tulthklahale made one of spotted clay. Etséhostin went to Teholtsody's house and found that the pot he had made was full of water. He returned home and told his wife. Traveling south, she found that Frog's pot was full of water. Josdelhashi, going west, found Salt Woman's pot full of water. Hostjaishjiné went north and found a pot of water in the house of Tulthklahale. He returned very angry. ""They are getting wiser than us,"" he said. ""They are growing rich and we are still poor. "" Etséhostin said, ""We will grow wise and have many things some day. "" He went east and west and borrowed a little water in each house, and his wife went north and south and did likewise. They planted it together in the ground, and in a few days there was a spring there with several kinds of plants growing around it. One of these was a reed with twelve joints. From it came the wind, which raised a heavy rain. When the rain stopped, everything looked beautiful. There was corn around the spring, pumpkin and squash to the east, watermelon and tobacco to the south, beans and cotton to the west, and muskmelon and gourds to the north. Hostin prayed and sang for more. They found a big shell and Turquoise in the spring, which Spider Woman brought out. Going to the other houses, they found a black bow and arrow in the east, stone knives in the south, cotton cloth in the west, and black cloth in the north. Hostin prayed for more and went to the spring. There, the corn was ripening, and they gathered it. Those living at the four corners had no corn and begged Hostin for some. But he would give them only pollen, which did not produce ear corn; he would give them no seed corn. Tehostsody said, ""When Hostin came to borrow water, we gave him some. "" Hostin said, ""I gave you some corn. "" Teholtsody and the others grew very angry and tried to destroy Hostin. But when Teholtsody sent Thunder against him, Horned Toad blocked the lightning, and Spider Woman, Hostjaishjiné, and Cicada protected Hostin against other attacks. Hostin then asked Hostjaishjiné to act against these people. He went to each of their houses and broke the water pots. All the waters met in the west, and there was a great flood. Hostin had everything he wanted, including large hollow reeds to float on, but the flood troubled the other people, since they had no means of floating on the water. As the world was gradually overflowed, the people at the four corners brought gifts to Hostin, begging for peace. Hostin did not take them but directed them to others. Teholtsody brought a bow and two arrows, which Cicada accepted; he passed the arrows through his body, making holes which you can see in the insect today. Frog brought tobacco, which Hostin referred to Hostjaishjiné. Salt Woman offered a cotton blanket, which Spider Woman took. Tulthklahale sent a flint shirt and cap, which went to Horned Toad. All were now on peaceable terms. Hostin went east and picked up a little earth from White mountain, which still showed above the water. Spider Woman wove a web so that the spring could not overflow yet. Old Man and Woman planted every living thing there and gathered the seeds. They all put their possessions into the reeds and got in themselves. Two young men came out of the spring and went to the reeds also. Cicada made a noise through the holes in his thorax, Black Wind shook the reed, and the reed grew higher and higher. The water covered the earth and kept rising. The reed kept growing until it reach the roof of the world. They could find no opening. As they wondered what to do, Spider Woman wove a web on the water which people sat upon as a raft. Hostjaishjiné started a hole in the roof with his knife, and Cicada bored the rest of the way through and came into the new world. Making noise with his thorax, he attracted the attention of swans, which came to him from the south, east, north, and west. He told them he came from the world below, but they would not believe him, and they told him that the place belonged to the swans. Finally, the swans agreed to accept payment. Cicada went back to his people and got the red substance that causes red sunsets. When the swans put it on their wings, they were much pleased. As they left, they carried off some of the water to leave dry land. The others came up to the new world. From earth gathered from four mountains in the lower world they again formed mountains, white at east, blue at south, yellow at west, and black at north. The boys from the spring were left at the Ute Mountains in the east. Old Man arranged for day and night. Old Man and Woman laid out corn and shells. After singing and praying over them, Wolf, Mountain Lion, Otter, and Beaver were raised. Old Man made these rulers over several regions. With Josdelhashi's help, they made six men and six women from skin. Coyote and yellow fox were born when the white of the east met the yellow of sunset. When the blue and black met, the blue fox and badger were born. Great Wolf was the chief of all the people. After a time, his wife made herself three sticks for gambling and would go off all day. Her husband had a great argument with her, and this led to him leading the men to the other side of the river to live apart from the women. Over the years, the women did not work their fields well, and they suffered greatly from hunger. The men prospered, but they still missed their wives. Eventually, the men and women reconciled and lived together again. Teholtsody had built his home under the river, and one night the cries of a baby were heard from his water house. Coyote tried to get the baby but failed. At Old Man's suggestion, he went to Spider Woman, who spread a web over the river, got the baby, and hid it away under her left arm. When Teholtsody could not find the baby, he grew crazy and said he would kill everyone until he found his child. He opened the earth at four corners and let the waters loose. At first, the people could not understand what they saw in the distance. The winds went and reported back that great bodies of water were coming together. The two youths from the spring came from the mountain Tcolii carrying with them a hollow reed and a sunflower stem, each with four flute holes. The people began to climb the mountains; the water came so quickly that they had time to gather only a few seeds. The youths planted the reed, and it began to grow. People got in it. At the bottom, Turkey's tail dragged in the water, making his feathers white. The four winds guarded the holes in the reed. Badger began to dig upward but came back again. Cicada dug then and shortly penetrated to another world, but he found nothing but water there. Soon a man with an axe came from the east; he struck at Cicada twelve times but could not hit him. A man came from each of the other three directions but likewise failed to hurt Cicada. Another man, Tcithkahilka, came from the east with two arrows. ""This is my land,"" he said. ""We shall see. We would like to live here at any rate. ""The man pushed one arrow up his anus and another down his throat and pushed both through. Then he threw them to Cicada, saying the land would be his if he could do that. Cicada said he could do better than that and pushed the arrows through his sides. The man picked up his arrows and left. In the same way, Cicada met the same challenge from men from the other three points. He returned to tell the people of the new world, and four of them came up. These gouged small canyons in each direction to drain the water. They went down again, and the winds came up and blew for four days to dry the land. When Badger came up, the ground was still muddy in places, and his short legs got stuck in the mud, which is why he has a black muzzle and black legs. The winds blew more. Big Gray Fly came up and found everything beautiful. After another twelve days, it was dry enough for everyone to come up. Spider Woman still carried Teholtsody's child under her arm. Some water came up through the hole and formed a lake. Hosjelti, a man whom Old Man had created in the previous world, laid the foundations of the houses of the Pueblo Indians, and his own people built hogans. Teholtsody was still searching for his child and wanted to follow the people into the upper world. The people did not know what to do. Finally, Spider Woman gave back the child, and Teholtsody returned to the lower world.","An elaborate and unusual account of a flood occurs in

Tcithkahilka, came from the east with two arrows. ""This is my land,"" he
said.""We shall see. We would like to live here at any rate.""The man pushed one arrow up his anus and another down his throat and
pushed both through. Then he threw them to Cicada, saying the land
would be his if he could do that. Cicada said he could do better than
that and pushed the arrows through his sides. The man picked up his
arrows and left. In the same way, Cicada met the same challenge from
men from the other three points.He returned to tell the people of the new world, and four of them came
up. These gouged small canyons in each direction to drain the water.
They went down again, and the winds came up and blew for four days to
dry the land. When Badger came up, the ground was still muddy in
places, and his short legs got stuck in the mud, which is why he has a
black muzzle and black legs. The winds blew more. Big Gray Fly came up
and found everything beautiful. After another twelve days, it was dry
enough for everyone to come up.Spider Woman still carried Teholtsody's child under her arm. Some water
came up through the hole and formed a lake. Hosjelti, a man whom Old
Man had created in the previous world, laid the foundations of the
houses of the Pueblo Indians, and his own people built hogans.
Teholtsody was still searching for his child and wanted to follow the
people into the upper world. The people did not know what to do.
Finally, Spider Woman gave back the child, and Teholtsody returned to
the lower world.","The first world was barren ground. Etséhostin and Etséasun, Old Man and Old Woman, existed there, and on the fourth day they began to think of eating. Hostjaishjiné rubbed some skin from his belly and laid it on the ground. The woman [Nastjeasun?] did the same. Etséhostin formed two rolls of skin from his back and laid them on the ground. From this arose a man with a mask, the first human. Etséasun created a woman called Josdelhashi from her skin. Etséhostin similarly created Teholtsody, a water monster, and Usheenasun, Salt Spirit. Hostin (Old Man) created a wing from a bit of his tongue. When he placed this on his ear, the wind would shake it and tell him everything. He also created a large frog, Tlalc, and a crane, Teklaliale. Etséasun created Thunder from her scalp skin and a feather. This makes twelve personages up to this time. Etséhostin asked Hostjaishjiné how to get food. Hostjaishjiné, who always looks angry, said, ""I do not know,"" but he created Wunustcinde, Cicada, from some skin on his neck. Etséasun asked Nastjeasun how to get food, and she created Nazozi, Ant, from which many little yellow ants came after four days. Hostjaishjiné created a horned toad, Nashongbitcijy. Etséhostin built a house there, but the ants annoyed people so that they could find no rest. Teholtsody traveled east, and as the world was very small then, he soon came to its limit and built his house there. In like manner, the frog traveled south, Salt Woman went west, and Tulthklahale went north, and each built a house. Etséhostin said, ""I wish we could get some clouds for rain,"" and he looked east and saw many clouds, for Teholtsody's house is of clouds. Etséasun said, ""I wish we had rain"" and saw in the south a heavy fog which was frog's house. Etséhostin prayed for rain and saw a mirage in the west. Etséasun prayed for rain and saw in the north a green water scum from which a house was made. Etséhostin sent Thunder naked to stand in the doorway of Teholtsody's house in the east. Teholtsody gave him a mantle and headdress of feathers which were lightning. Etséhostin and Etséasun sent other beings to stand in the doorways of the others' houses. Teholtsody had made a water vessel of white clay. Frog made one of blue clay. Usheenasun made one of yellow clay. Tulthklahale made one of spotted clay. Etséhostin went to Teholtsody's house and found that the pot he had made was full of water. He returned home and told his wife. Traveling south, she found that Frog's pot was full of water. Josdelhashi, going west, found Salt Woman's pot full of water. Hostjaishjiné went north and found a pot of water in the house of Tulthklahale. He returned very angry. ""They are getting wiser than us,"" he said. ""They are growing rich and we are still poor. "" Etséhostin said, ""We will grow wise and have many things some day. "" He went east and west and borrowed a little water in each house, and his wife went north and south and did likewise. They planted it together in the ground, and in a few days there was a spring there with several kinds of plants growing around it. One of these was a reed with twelve joints. From it came the wind, which raised a heavy rain. When the rain stopped, everything looked beautiful. There was corn around the spring, pumpkin and squash to the east, watermelon and tobacco to the south, beans and cotton to the west, and muskmelon and gourds to the north. Hostin prayed and sang for more. They found a big shell and Turquoise in the spring, which Spider Woman brought out. Going to the other houses, they found a black bow and arrow in the east, stone knives in the south, cotton cloth in the west, and black cloth in the north. Hostin prayed for more and went to the spring. There, the corn was ripening, and they gathered it. Those living at the four corners had no corn and begged Hostin for some. But he would give them only pollen, which did not produce ear corn; he would give them no seed corn. Tehostsody said, ""When Hostin came to borrow water, we gave him some. "" Hostin said, ""I gave you some corn. "" Teholtsody and the others grew very angry and tried to destroy Hostin. But when Teholtsody sent Thunder against him, Horned Toad blocked the lightning, and Spider Woman, Hostjaishjiné, and Cicada protected Hostin against other attacks. Hostin then asked Hostjaishjiné to act against these people. He went to each of their houses and broke the water pots. All the waters met in the west, and there was a great flood. Hostin had everything he wanted, including large hollow reeds to float on, but the flood troubled the other people, since they had no means of floating on the water. As the world was gradually overflowed, the people at the four corners brought gifts to Hostin, begging for peace. Hostin did not take them but directed them to others. Teholtsody brought a bow and two arrows, which Cicada accepted; he passed the arrows through his body, making holes which you can see in the insect today. Frog brought tobacco, which Hostin referred to Hostjaishjiné. Salt Woman offered a cotton blanket, which Spider Woman took. Tulthklahale sent a flint shirt and cap, which went to Horned Toad. All were now on peaceable terms. Hostin went east and picked up a little earth from White mountain, which still showed above the water. Spider Woman wove a web so that the spring could not overflow yet. Old Man and Woman planted every living thing there and gathered the seeds. They all put their possessions into the reeds and got in themselves. Two young men came out of the spring and went to the reeds also. Cicada made a noise through the holes in his thorax, Black Wind shook the reed, and the reed grew higher and higher. The water covered the earth and kept rising. The reed kept growing until it reach the roof of the world. They could find no opening. As they wondered what to do, Spider Woman wove a web on the water which people sat upon as a raft. Hostjaishjiné started a hole in the roof with his knife, and Cicada bored the rest of the way through and came into the new world. Making noise with his thorax, he attracted the attention of swans, which came to him from the south, east, north, and west. He told them he came from the world below, but they would not believe him, and they told him that the place belonged to the swans. Finally, the swans agreed to accept payment. Cicada went back to his people and got the red substance that causes red sunsets. When the swans put it on their wings, they were much pleased. As they left, they carried off some of the water to leave dry land. The others came up to the new world. From earth gathered from four mountains in the lower world they again formed mountains, white at east, blue at south, yellow at west, and black at north. The boys from the spring were left at the Ute Mountains in the east. Old Man arranged for day and night. Old Man and Woman laid out corn and shells. After singing and praying over them, Wolf, Mountain Lion, Otter, and Beaver were raised. Old Man made these rulers over several regions. With Josdelhashi's help, they made six men and six women from skin. Coyote and yellow fox were born when the white of the east met the yellow of sunset. When the blue and black met, the blue fox and badger were born. Great Wolf was the chief of all the people. After a time, his wife made herself three sticks for gambling and would go off all day. Her husband had a great argument with her, and this led to him leading the men to the other side of the river to live apart from the women. Over the years, the women did not work their fields well, and they suffered greatly from hunger. The men prospered, but they still missed their wives. Eventually, the men and women reconciled and lived together again. Teholtsody had built his home under the river, and one night the cries of a baby were heard from his water house. Coyote tried to get the baby but failed. At Old Man's suggestion, he went to Spider Woman, who spread a web over the river, got the baby, and hid it away under her left arm. When Teholtsody could not find the baby, he grew crazy and said he would kill everyone until he found his child. He opened the earth at four corners and let the waters loose. At first, the people could not understand what they saw in the distance. The winds went and reported back that great bodies of water were coming together. The two youths from the spring came from the mountain Tcolii carrying with them a hollow reed and a sunflower stem, each with four flute holes. The people began to climb the mountains; the water came so quickly that they had time to gather only a few seeds. The youths planted the reed, and it began to grow. People got in it. At the bottom, Turkey's tail dragged in the water, making his feathers white. The four winds guarded the holes in the reed. Badger began to dig upward but came back again. Cicada dug then and shortly penetrated to another world, but he found nothing but water there. Soon a man with an axe came from the east; he struck at Cicada twelve times but could not hit him. A man came from each of the other three directions but likewise failed to hurt Cicada. Another man, Tcithkahilka, came from the east with two arrows. ""This is my land,"" he said. ""We shall see.

Yayali the Giant came up the mountain. Chipmunk heard him and, thinking it was his brother-in-law, went to meet him. Chipmunk realized his mistake too late. The Giant saw him and had him lead the way to his home, where he killed him. Giant then made himself at home and married Chipmunk's widow. Giant cooked Chipmunk and told his new wife to eat the meat. She said, ""You eat it. ""When the Giant left the house, Chipmunk's widow dug a hole and hid her daughter by Chipmunk there. Giant returned at sundown, with the bodies of many people he had killed. ""We have plenty of meat,"" he said. The woman cooked the meat but ate deer meat herself. Day after day, the Giant left in the morning, placing large boulders against the doors so his wife could not get out. While he was away, she cooked deer meat that Chipmunk had obtained, feeding that to her daughter. The Giant returned every night carrying many dead people. ""I am a better husband than you had before,"" he said. ""I get you more meat. "" He tried to make her eat the meat, but she only pretended to eat it and ate deer meat instead. When it became dark, the Giant danced. He was so tall that his head stuck through the house's smoke hole. The Giant's wife gave birth to two boys, both of them little giants. She wanted to kill them but was afraid of the Giant. She cried all day, mourning Chipmunk. Chipmunk's brother dreamed about him and decided to visit. When he arrived, he found the boulders against the door, and his sister-in-law told him about the Giant. He rolled away the boulder and told her and her daughter to run to her father's house.

him how to make and use a sling. Wekwek went back to the area, killed
hundreds of birds, gathered them, and brought them back to Olle. The
next day, Wekwek saw Sahte, Weasel-man, coming and going and was
curious about him. Wekwek followed Sahte north to Clear Lake and found
his home while Sahte was out. He found several sacks of shell-bead
money there and took it all back with him. When Sahte returned, he
wanted to find out who stole his money. He set fire to one end of a
stick and pointed it in different directions. When it pointed south
towards the thief, the flame leaped from the stick and spread
southward. Wekwek was concerned when he saw that the country to the
north was on fire, and he told Olle. Olle knew the reason for the
fire, but he said only, ""The people up there are burning tules."" When
the fire came close so that Wekwek thought they would soon burn, he
confessed to Olle that he had stolen the money and hidden it in the
creek. Olle then took a sack from his roundhouse and beat it against
an oak tree, creating fog. He beat another sack against the tree,
causing more fog, and then rain. He said the rain would last for ten
days and nights. The rain covered all the land except the top of Mount
Konokti. Wekwek flew around in the rain and eventually found that
refuge. On the tenth day, the rain stopped, and the water started
going down. After about a week, the land was bare again. At that time,
there were no real people in the world. Olle took the feathers of the
geese that Wekwek had killed at Wennok lake. They traveled over the
country, and whenever they found a good site, Olle laid two feathers
side by side. The next morning, each pair of feathers had turned into
a man and a woman. Later, Wekwek commented to Olle that the people had
no fire, and Olle sent Wekewillah, the Shrew-mice brothers, to steal
fire from Kahkahte, the Crow, who had it at his roundhouse. They
succeeded, and Olle put the fire in the buckeye tree.","Merriam, C. Hart. The Dawn of the World (Lincolnand London: University of Nebraska Press, 1910, 1993), 138-151.",36.7783,-119.4179,Americas,North America,California,United States,9/16/2021

At length, they reached their destination and saw Halai Auna (morning star), Wakara's daughter. Igupa Topa put himself into his nephew's heart to strengthen him. Halai Auna was pleased by Pun Miaupa, but she went home and told Wakara she had seen a man. Wakara welcomed Pun Miaupa formally, but then went to his brother Tuina (sun) to see what he thought of Halai Auna's new husband. Tuina had a pipe with tobacco made from his own hair and gave it to Pun Miaupa to smoke, expecting it to kill him. But Igupa Topa in his heart took the smoke, so Pun Miaupa was unharmed. Tiuna repeated the test with increasingly stronger tobaccos made from his skin, flesh, brains, and marrow, to no effect. Igupa Topa left Pun Miaupa's heart that night; Tiupa saw him the next morning and knew the source of Pun Miaupa's power. They offered Igupa Topa food, but he ate nothing until night came; then he ate everything in the house except venison. The same happened the next day. The women fixing the food complained, and Tiuna said he didn't like Igupa Topa either. Igupa Topa heard this; he raised a great cloud and caused heavy rain. He brought his nephew and Halai Auna to the roof of the sweat house. The rain filled the valleys and came up to the roof of the house. Everyone else, inside the house, drowned. At daylight, the rain stopped and the water lowered. Halai Auna cried for her family, but Pun Miaupa told her that his uncle would restore them to life. Just after midday, Igupa Topa looked at the dead bodies and said, ""Why sleep all day? It is time to be up!"" and the people arose as if from sleep. Later, Wakara took his new son-in-law to play a sport in which one person bends down a tall pole as the other goes to the top and tries to hold on as the pole is released to spring back. Wakara tried to kill Pun Miaupa by pulling the pole very low, but Igupa Topa had entered Pun Miaupa's heart again, giving him the strength to hold on. When it was Wakara's turn to climb the pole, Pun Miaupa bent it very low and flung Wakara into the sky, where he stays. Pun Miaupa went back home with his uncle an Halai Auna. Wakara's other daughters grieved the loss of Wakara. Chuhna (spider) fastened a rope to the sky and drew up all of Wakara's daughters and their husbands; they stay on the sky as stars.","Pun Miaupa, son of Rainbow, left home and went north to get the
youngest daughter of Wakara (moon). On the way, he went to his uncle
Igupa Topa. Igupa Topa knew that Wakara killed all his daughter's
suitors, so he went along to help his nephew. Pun Miaupa was
concerned because Igupa Topa was old and fell every few steps, but

Igupa Topa heard this; he raised a great cloud and caused heavy rain.

There was a world before this one. It lasted a long, long time, and many people lived in it before the present people came. Katkatchila (swift) was one of those people. He could hunt wonderfully; he had something which he aimed and threw, but nobody could find out what it was. Torihas (blue crane) was the chief of the people who lived in the upper Sacramento valley. ""Let us send for Katkatchila,"" he said one day. ""Let us invite him to a great dance. "" He sent Tsaroki Sakahl (green snake) with the invitation, and Katkatchila agreed to come. He came the following day and sat down a little way off from where people were dancing. Torihas saw him and said, ""Come over, Katkatchila, and sit by me. ""Olelbis happened to be looking down from Olelpanti just then. He said to those around him, ""I see many people gathered together. They are going to do something. ""After the dance, Katkatchila gladly accepted Torihas's invitation to hunt with them. Torihas's people planned, when Katkatchila killed a deer, to rush up to it and take the thing with which he killed it. On the first day of the hunt, Torihas sent his grandson Kaisus (grey squirrel), a swift runner. Whenever Katkatchila shot a deer, Kaisus rushed to the deer, but Katkatchila was always faster and had already taken out the weapon. Katkatchila was ready to leave then, but Torihas persuaded him to hunt one more day. That day, Hau (red fox) went with him. Hau sprang forward the moment the weapon was shot and reached the deer first. He found the flint weapon and hid it in his ear. Katkatchila demanded it back, but Hau denied having taken it. Katkatchila kept asking for it all day, but Hau never owned to taking it. Finally he left, saying, ""I saw you take my flint. It would be much better for you and your people to give it back to me. You will see something in pay for this. ""After he left, the others examined the flint. Hilit (house fly) rubbed the flint with his hands and legs, making it large. He worked all night until it was four or five feet long. Patsotchet (badger) had warned that Katkatchila would make trouble, and in the morning people agreed that they should not keep the flint there. Torihas asked Patsotchet to carry it north, but he said it was too heavy. He asked Karili (coon) to carry it, but he also found it too heavy. Finally, Tichelis (ground squirrel) put the flint on his back and headed away north. Meanwhile, when Katkatchila reached home, he told his sister Yonot (buckeye), her husband Tilikus (fire-drill), and her husband's brother Poharamas (shooting star) of the theft. They cleared an area in front of their house and made a large pile of finely split pine sticks there. Yonot had a baby whom she called Pohila (fire child). She brought out Pohila and sat him next to the pine sticks, and fire blazed up. Poharamus took a burning brand and ran southeast to where the sky meets the earth, and Tilikus did the same in the southwest. Both ran northward near the sky leaving a trail of fire behind them. The fire spread to Torihas's people, making a terrible roar as it came from the south, east, and west. People ran to the north. Tichelis, struggling with the great block of flint on his back, saw that there was no escape for him above ground, so he threw down the flint and ran under the ground. The flint lies there yet, and the Wintu go there when they want black flint. Just before the brothers Poharamus and Tilikus met in the north, two people rushed out between them; they were Klabus (mole) and Tsaroki, who had carried the invitation to Katkatchila. Katkatchila, Yonot, Pohila, and Tilikus went behind the sky. Poharamus went to Olelpanti, where Olelbis lives in a wonderful house made from living oaks. Olelbis looked down on the world and saw only waves of flame. The sparks stuck fast in the sky and remain there as stars. Fire in the rocks also came from the wakpohas, or world fire. Olelbis's grandmothers told him of Kahit (wind) who lives in the far north outside the first sky, sitting with his head in his hands facing north. They told him to summon Kahit and to have him bring Mem Loimis (water). Olelbis sent Lutchi (hummingbird) to prop up the sky, and he had Sutunut (black eagle) deliver the message to Kahit. Kahit turned his face to the south. Sotchet (beaver), who lived just south of Kahit, urged him on. His mother was Mem Loimis, and he told Kahit he would help them forward. Olelbis made an oak paddle and threw it to Sotchet, who made a tail of it. Kahit and Mem Loimis came through the opening in the sky. Mem Loimis came first, followed closely by Kahit, who was blowing his whistle with all his might. The water covered the earth, putting out the fire, and rose to the top of the sky. All kinds of people who could swim came with them, such as Yoholmit (frog) and Sosini (a water bird). Some of these people Olelbis sent far away; others stayed at Olelpanti. Olelbis told Kahit that they had wind and water enough, and Kahit drove Mem Loimis back to her home in the ground in the north. Olelbis looked down and saw nothing but naked rock. There was no water left except in a rock basin at Tsarau Heril. But Yilahl (gopher) told him that there was soil in the west beyond the sky. At Olelbis's bidding, Klabus (mole) worked five days bringing baskets of earth and spreading it over the world. He and Yilahl then raised mountains and hills. ""We need fire,"" Olelbis said. Seeing smoke in the southwest where Yonot had returned with Pohila, he sent Tede Wiu (a small bird) to get some fire. The house was closed, but after five days Tede Wiu caught a spark that came out and quickly carried it to Olelbis. With a stick, Olelbis made furrows for rivers and streams. He threw a grapevine root and tule roots onto the earth, and water flowed from where they hit. He directed Tsurat (woodpecker) to carry Hlihli (white oak acorn) over the earth; meal drifted out of it, and oak trees sprung up everywhere. Olelbis also spread seeds of all kinds of plants from around his lodge. When the water hit the great fire, the steam and smoke was driven south and became a people, the cloud people. Katkatchila and his brother tried to keep them from going north, but the clouds were very wild. Olelbis told them to make a fence where the clouds pass, leave one gap in it, and to put a snare in the gap. They did so and caught one black cloud; the rest broke down the fence and got away. They gave the cloud to Olelbis, who skinned it and gave the skin to his grandmother. They repaired the fence and caught a white cloud, which Olelbis also skinned and gave to the other grandmother. Now, when they hang out the white skin, white clouds go to the south and bring rain. When they hang out the black skin, the black clouds come and bring heavy rain. The clouds that escaped became a new people and sometimes bring snow. Olelbis sent to earth all of the people who were not needed at his home. The great people he kept at Olelpanti, but he sent down parts of each to turn into something in the world below.","Olelbis is the Wintu supreme being; he lives in

rocks also came from the wakpohas, or world fire.Olelbis's grandmothers told him of Kahit (wind) who lives in the
far north outside the first sky, sitting with his head in his hands
facing north. They told him to summon Kahit and to have him bring Mem
Loimis (water). Olelbis sent Lutchi (hummingbird) to prop up the sky,
and he had Sutunut (black eagle) deliver the message to Kahit. Kahit
turned his face to the south. Sotchet (beaver), who lived just south
of Kahit, urged him on. His mother was Mem Loimis, and he told Kahit
he would help them forward. Olelbis made an oak paddle and threw it
to Sotchet, who made a tail of it.Kahit and Mem Loimis came through the opening in the sky. Mem
Loimis came first, followed closely by Kahit, who was blowing his
whistle with all his might. The water covered the earth, putting out
the fire, and rose to the top of the sky. All kinds of people who
could swim came with them, such as Yoholmit (frog) and Sosini (a water
bird). Some of these people Olelbis sent far away; others stayed at
Olelpanti.Olelbis told Kahit that they had wind and water enough, and Kahit
drove Mem Loimis back to her home in the ground in the north. Olelbis
looked down and saw nothing but naked rock. There was no water left
except in a rock basin at Tsarau Heril. But Yilahl (gopher) told him
that there was soil in the west beyond the sky. At Olelbis's bidding,
Klabus (mole) worked five days bringing baskets of earth and spreading
it over the world. He and Yilahl then raised mountains and hills.""We need fire,"" Olelbis said. Seeing smoke in the southwest where
Yonot had returned with Pohila, he sent Tede Wiu (a small bird) to get
some fire. The house was closed, but after five days Tede Wiu caught
a spark that came out and quickly carried it to Olelbis.With a stick, Olelbis made furrows for rivers and streams. He
threw a grapevine root and tule roots onto the earth, and water flowed
from where they hit. He directed Tsurat (woodpecker) to carry Hlihli
(white oak acorn) over the earth; meal drifted out of it, and oak
trees sprung up everywhere. Olelbis also spread seeds of all kinds of
plants from around his lodge.When the water hit the great fire, the steam and smoke was driven
south and became a people, the cloud people. Katkatchila and his
brother tried to keep them from going north, but the clouds were very
wild. Olelbis told them to make a fence where the clouds pass, leave
one gap in it, and to put a snare in the gap. They did so and caught
one black cloud; the rest broke down the fence and got away. They
gave the cloud to Olelbis, who skinned it and gave the skin to his
grandmother. They repaired the fence and caught a white cloud, which
Olelbis also skinned and gave to the other grandmother. Now, when
they hang out the white skin, white clouds go to the south and bring
rain. When they hang out the black skin, the black clouds come and
bring heavy rain. The clouds that escaped became a new people and
sometimes bring snow.Olelbis sent to earth all of the people who were not needed at his
home. The great people he kept at Olelpanti, but he sent down parts
of each to turn into something in the world below.","Olelbis is the Wintu supreme being; he lives in Olelpanti, the highest place above the sky.","Olelbis is the Wintu supreme being; he lives in

An old man living near Okego [Tuley Creek], drew sinews for making a bow, putting them in a basket as he finished them. Once he noticed the basket moving. When he looked inside, he saw something very small lying there. ""You will become a person,"" he said, and he made the basket stronger. Every day the boy grew larger. Before long he was a tall young man. Pulekukwerek, Wohpekumeu, Kewomer, Eagle, and others were at Kenek, downstream. They played and gambled every day. The old man told the boy to stay away from them. The boy went along the edge of the river and practiced racing against flying ducks. When he could outpace them, he shot arrows and ran against them. When he outraced an arrow, he thought, ""Now I think I can do something. ""Coyote became angry with the sun because two of his children froze to death one day when the sun went away behind clouds. He prepared some sharp stones and went east, to where the sun lived. He went into the sweathouse. In the evening, ten others came in, including the sun. He began telling all the news. One of them said, ""I hear two children froze to death. Is that true?"" Sun said, ""Yes, that is what I saw. "" When they laughed a little at that, Coyote struck Sun twice and fled. Mouse had earlier told him to take the poorer path, but without realizing it, Coyote took the well-traveled one. When he realized he had fled into the sky, he looked down and thought, ""It is not too far. "" He spat, and seeing that his spit did not go far, he jumped. He went right through the cloud that he had spat on and continued falling. His bones scattered all about when he hit. In Kenek, they wondered why day did not come. Wohpekumeu, walking downstream, noticed something white and saw that it was the Sun who had been killed. But none of the people there were strong enough to lift him and put him back. A hundred together could not even lift his foot. Though they did not know if he could help, they sent a messenger to Okego for Rumitsek-onohsun (Grown-in-a-Basket). He came. Without saying anything or looking at anyone, he shifted Sun with his left hand, put his right hand under him, and threw him up so that he stuck against the sky. Turning around, Grown-in-a-Basket left without looking at anyone. He did not see that many of them, shamed at being so far surpassed, turned into rocks, shrubs, and other things. Now those who had been at Kenek went off to another place, for they were ashamed of the Okego young man. One day, Grown-in-a-Basket went to Kenek to see them. He found only Spider, who told him that they had left to avoid him. Grown-at-Okego still wanted to see them, so Spider led him to a hill on the prairie, attached his string to an arrow, and told him to shoot it. He did, and the arrow stuck in the sky. Spider climbed up and let down a ladder, which the young man climbed. ""The best of men are here,"" Spider told him. He went to where they were. ""Let him play shinny,"" one of them said. ""I cannot play,"" he said. ""Well, try it nevertheless. "" Then he struck the ball to the very end of the sky and won the game. When he had beaten them, some of them, from shame, turned into things. When he saw that nearly all of them had changed, Spider said, ""Let us go back. "" ""Yes, let us go back,"" he said. When he came back to Okego, a few people were left at Kenek, and those wanted to leave. Wohpeltun said, ""Go ahead, I shall be the last one to leave. "" But he stayed because he wanted to kill Grown-at-Okego. Shortly after leaving, Pulekukwerek wondered what Wohpeltun meant to do and headed back to confront him. But the river had already risen, and he could not continue. When Grown-at-Okego saw the river rising, he knew it was meant for him. So he tied his house onto a large box and his sweathouse onto the box's cover. He entered the house, and the old man entered the sweathouse. The water rose. They heard the roof of the house striking against the sky. Water was everywhere. Mountains and hills were made when the water ran off. The house came down in the same place where it stood before. It is the rock pile at Okego now.","Pulekukwerek and Wohpekumeu are trickster-heroes who
figure in many Yurok tales, though they have just bit parts in this
one.An old man living near Okego [Tuley Creek], drew sinews for making
a bow, putting them in a basket as he finished them. Once he noticed
the basket moving. When he looked inside, he saw something very small
lying there. ""You will become a person,"" he said, and he made the
basket stronger. Every day the boy grew larger. Before long he was a
tall young man.Pulekukwerek, Wohpekumeu, Kewomer, Eagle, and others were at Kenek,
downstream. They played and gambled every day. The old man told the
boy to stay away from them. The boy went along the edge of the river
and practiced racing against flying ducks. When he could outpace
them, he shot arrows and ran against them. When he outraced an arrow,
he thought, ""Now I think I can do something.""Coyote became angry with the sun because two of his children froze
to death one day when the sun went away behind clouds. He prepared
some sharp stones and went east, to where the sun lived. He went into
the sweathouse. In the evening, ten others came in, including the
sun. He began telling all the news. One of them said, ""I hear two
children froze to death. Is that true?"" Sun said, ""Yes, that is what
I saw."" When they laughed a little at that, Coyote struck Sun twice
and fled. Mouse had earlier told him to take the poorer path, but
without realizing it, Coyote took the well-traveled one. When he
realized he had fled into the sky, he looked down and thought, ""It is
not too far."" He spat, and seeing that his spit did not go far, he
jumped. He went right through the cloud that he had spat on and
continued falling. His bones scattered all about when he hit.In Kenek, they wondered why day did not come. Wohpekumeu, walking
downstream, noticed something white and saw that it was the Sun who
had been killed. But none of the people there were strong enough to
lift him and put him back. A hundred together could not even lift his
foot. Though they did not know if he could help, they sent a
messenger to Okego for Rumitsek-onohsun (Grown-in-a-Basket). He came.
Without saying anything or looking at anyone, he shifted Sun with his
left hand, put his right hand under him, and threw him up so that he
stuck against the sky. Turning around, Grown-in-a-Basket left without
looking at anyone. He did not see that many of them, shamed at being
so far surpassed, turned into rocks, shrubs, and other things.Now those who had been at Kenek went off to another place, for they
were ashamed of the Okego young man. One day, Grown-in-a-Basket went
to Kenek to see them. He found only Spider, who told him that they
had left to avoid him. Grown-at-Okego still wanted to see them, so

An orphan boy named Of-Unknown-Parents, who lived with an old man and an old woman in the corner of the village, went to the center of the village and said that the thirteen people were no longer alive. They had gone into the ground, he said, and would not return, but people should go two days out and look for a place where many people would be coming out of the ground. That night, Of-Unknown-Parents heard someone calling him. That person told him that his prophecy was mistaken. He told Of-Unknown-Parents that his father had sent him, that his father would do something in a year, and that he, the visitor, would appear again. Now the chief's wife, who had a son among the thirteen missing men, gave birth to four children shaped like dogs. They grew rapidly, so that after three days they played with other children. But they were mean and ran over the children. When they were grown, the chief had had enough of them and got people to carry them off to the west. But the dogs, now very large, swallowed the people who were taking them. As time went on, these monstrous creatures, who had long necks, would reach out and swallow any people who went near them. People would not go west for fear of them. The older people said that the Creator had made the monster to destroy everyone, and if things went on this way, more bad things would be done. One night, the visitor appeared to Of-Unknown-Parents again, telling him to go to a certain place due north at noon. The boy went there and saw this person, who told the boy that his father did not like the way things were going and would destroy everything. Then the visitor told the boy to do certain things: He must tell the people of the village. He must get the twelve longest canes he could find, tie them together, give them to Spider-Woman, and tell her to get her servant (Mouse-Woman) to gather corn of all colors. When this is done, he must put the canes into the ground up to five joints; then look out for something to come from the north after four days. A certain thing in the water would destroy the monsters. The boy returned to the village and told the chief what was to happen, but the chief would not believe him. Then he went to Spider-Woman and told her as he had been commanded. Spider-Woman got the twelve long canes, and her servant got seeds of corn, beans, pumpkins, and seeds of every kind. Spider-Woman filled the canes with all the seeds. Then Of-Unknown-Parents told her do dig a hole for the reeds with a buffalo rib. When that was done, he commanded a small whirlwind to blow. It raised the canes up, and they set them in the hole up to the fifth joint. The time came for something to happen. At noon they looked north and saw something like the wind blowing, but it was birds heading south. Then came the animals, first the buffalo, then deer, and so on. A little later they saw a great flood coming, and they saw a great turtle, which headed to the monsters and stopped under their feet. Spider-Woman climbed to the top of the canes and let down a rope for her husband, the boy, and Mouse-Woman. She made a shelter there which the water would not leak through. By the evening, the water covered all the village. The monsters could hardly stand, it was so slippery. At last, one at at time, they grew too tired to stand. They fell north, east, south, and west, first calling out the name by which the direction would be known. It was twelve more days before the flood passed. There was no wind, but a certain person came from above, named Man-Going-All-Around, who had the power to dry all slime. Coming from the northeast, he saw a shadow on the ground and went to look. It was something shaped like a woman. He left and went all around, and when he came to the place again, he saw that the upper half of the woman was alive, and the lower half was still mud. The woman (Shadow-Woman) had given birth to a child, Standing-Sweet-Grass. He went on his journey again. A dove came there; it had a piece of grass in its mouth. The woman then was sitting up with the child in her lap. When Man-Going-All-Around returned a third time, he told the woman to accompany him, and he took her to a place where, in his travels, he had heard drums. This was a room like a beaver's lodge. Many people were sitting about there. Shadow-Woman and a young man there agreed to live together. After five days, Standing-Sweet-Grass was a boy who could talk. He went out and reached the spot where the people were on the top of the canes. He told Spider-Woman to let down the rope with Of-Unknown-Parents on it. When he was down, he was told to command the wind to blow the north, east, south, and west, into the ground. Then the canes went down to the west. They all went to Beaver's-Lodge, taking the canes with them, and gave the seeds to Shadow-Woman, for the use of all people. Standing-Sweet-Grass started on a journey. He commanded the trees to grow and the water to flow. He changed muddy forms left by the flood into hills and mountains. He commanded the wild animals to roam. Then, with the birds around him, he announced that he would not return to his mother, but would go to his father, the Man-Above. He put the birds into a trance, and when they came to they saw only a little bunch of standing sweet-grass where he had been.","A young man named Every-Direction went out on an expedition with

Beaver's-Lodge, taking the canes with them, and gave the seeds to
Shadow-Woman, for the use of all people.Standing-Sweet-Grass started on a journey. He commanded the trees
to grow and the water to flow. He changed muddy forms left by the
flood into hills and mountains. He commanded the wild animals to
roam. Then, with the birds around him, he announced that he would not
return to his mother, but would go to his father, the Man-Above. He
put the birds into a trance, and when they came to they saw only a
little bunch of standing sweet-grass where he had been.","A young man named Every-Direction went out on an expedition with twelve other men, and they did not return for a long time. An orphan boy named Of-Unknown-Parents, who lived with an old man and an old woman in the corner of the village, went to the center of the village and said that the thirteen people were no longer alive. They had gone into the ground, he said, and would not return, but people should go two days out and look for a place where many people would be coming out of the ground. That night, Of-Unknown-Parents heard someone calling him. That person told him that his prophecy was mistaken. He told Of-Unknown-Parents that his father had sent him, that his father would do something in a year, and that he, the visitor, would appear again. Now the chief's wife, who had a son among the thirteen missing men, gave birth to four children shaped like dogs. They grew rapidly, so that after three days they played with other children. But they were mean and ran over the children. When they were grown, the chief had had enough of them and got people to carry them off to the west. But the dogs, now very large, swallowed the people who were taking them. As time went on, these monstrous creatures, who had long necks, would reach out and swallow any people who went near them. People would not go west for fear of them. The older people said that the Creator had made the monster to destroy everyone, and if things went on this way, more bad things would be done. One night, the visitor appeared to Of-Unknown-Parents again, telling him to go to a certain place due north at noon. The boy went there and saw this person, who told the boy that his father did not like the way things were going and would destroy everything. Then the visitor told the boy to do certain things: He must tell the people of the village. He must get the twelve longest canes he could find, tie them together, give them to Spider-Woman, and tell her to get her servant (Mouse-Woman) to gather corn of all colors. When this is done, he must put the canes into the ground up to five joints; then look out for something to come from the north after four days. A certain thing in the water would destroy the monsters. The boy returned to the village and told the chief what was to happen, but the chief would not believe him. Then he went to Spider-Woman and told her as he had been commanded. Spider-Woman got the twelve long canes, and her servant got seeds of corn, beans, pumpkins, and seeds of every kind. Spider-Woman filled the canes with all the seeds. Then Of-Unknown-Parents told her do dig a hole for the reeds with a buffalo rib. When that was done, he commanded a small whirlwind to blow. It raised the canes up, and they set them in the hole up to the fifth joint. The time came for something to happen. At noon they looked north and saw something like the wind blowing, but it was birds heading south. Then came the animals, first the buffalo, then deer, and so on. A little later they saw a great flood coming, and they saw a great turtle, which headed to the monsters and stopped under their feet. Spider-Woman climbed to the top of the canes and let down a rope for her husband, the boy, and Mouse-Woman. She made a shelter there which the water would not leak through. By the evening, the water covered all the village. The monsters could hardly stand, it was so slippery. At last, one at at time, they grew too tired to stand. They fell north, east, south, and west, first calling out the name by which the direction would be known. It was twelve more days before the flood passed. There was no wind, but a certain person came from above, named Man-Going-All-Around, who had the power to dry all slime. Coming from the northeast, he saw a shadow on the ground and went to look. It was something shaped like a woman. He left and went all around, and when he came to the place again, he saw that the upper half of the woman was alive, and the lower half was still mud. The woman (Shadow-Woman) had given birth to a child, Standing-Sweet-Grass. He went on his journey again. A dove came there; it had a piece of grass in its mouth. The woman then was sitting up with the child in her lap. When Man-Going-All-Around returned a third time, he told the woman to accompany him, and he took her to a place where, in his travels, he had heard drums. This was a room like a beaver's lodge. Many people were sitting about there. Shadow-Woman and a young man there agreed to live together. After five days, Standing-Sweet-Grass was a boy who could talk. He went out and reached the spot where the people were on the top of the canes. He told Spider-Woman to let down the rope with Of-Unknown-Parents on it. When he was down, he was told to command the wind to blow the north, east, south, and west, into the ground. Then the canes went down to the west.

An old man, his wife, daughter, and little son lived near a river. The old man was sick and unable to hunt. Every day, the girl would go for water. One day, she found a dead rabbit. She wondered how it came to be there, but she brought it back home, and the old man was glad for the meat. Next morning, the girl found a dead antelope by the trail. Now she suspected something strange and made a hiding place to watch that night. Toward morning, a _wanou_ (a large wart) came rolling along. It laid an elk by the trail and said, ""By now my food must be getting fat. ""When it left, the girl ran to tell her parents what she had seen and heard. ""It must be planning to catch us,"" she said. She told her family to prepare for traveling. When night came, she took a pair of old moccasins from her mother, her father, her brother, and herself and placed them under different tent poles. Then they fled. The wart brought a buffalo cow that morning and a buffalo bull the next, but seeing that the cow had not been moved, it realized the family was trying to escape. Thereupon it swallowed the cow and bull and went after them. First it went to their tent, but they were not there. It swallowed the tent and everything in it except the four pairs of old moccasins which had been hidden. Then it followed the family's trail. When it had almost caught up with them, it heard the old man crying behind it, so it returned to the source of the noise, swallowed the man's moccasins, and went in pursuit again. The woman's, girl's and boy's moccasins called it back in the same way as it gained on them. At last the woman, and then the old man became exhausted, and the children, after brief but tearful goodbyes, went on without them. The boy also fell back. The wart caught and devoured all three. As the girl ran through some woods, she found a man chopping wood. She said to him, ""A powerful being is chasing me. Help me escape, and I will be your wife. "" The man said, ""Continue fleeing. I cannot help you. "" Four time the girl asked him, and the fourth time he said, ""Run around me four times. ""Soon the wart came up to the man and said, ""Where is my food?"" The man said, ""She went on. "" The wart went off but soon returned and asked again, and the man said the same thing. After the fourth time, the wart said, ""Give me the girl, or I will devour you. "" The man had a third eye on the back of his neck. When the wart opened its mouth to swallow him, the man, who had been cutting a bow, wedged the bow in the wart's mouth. Four times the wart tried to swallow the bow, but it could not. ""You are more powerful than me,"" the wart said. ""Hit me in the middle. "" The man did so, and wart broke open. The old man and woman were already dead, and the boy died soon after. The man asked the girl if she loved her brother, and when she said yes, he kicked the boy and said, ""Get up, my brother-in-law. "" He did this four times, and the boy stood. The boy's name was Beaver-foot. His sister's name was River-woman. The man took them to his home, where he had a wife called Crow-woman. The man warned his new wife not to go out anywhere with Crow-woman, who was jealous. But when the others were out, Crow-woman urged the girl to go with her to a swing over a pool in the river. River-woman refused the first three times she was asked. In the meantime, she had a son. The fourth time, Crow-woman said, ""I will make you come. "" The girl went, and when she swung on the rope, the rope broke, and she fell into the pool. Crow-woman said, ""Here is your food, my grandfather. "" She had done this with all her husband's previous wives. Crow-woman returned and told her husband that River-woman had insisted on swinging over the pond and had drowned when the rope broke. Beaver-foot took his sister's crying son down to the pond, dipping in his finger in hope of quenching the infant's thirst with water, but the baby was not quieted. Then there was a sudden wave, and his sister appeared above the water to her waist, riding on the neck of a hiintcabiit. Beaver-foot held the infant to her breast until it was satisfied; then he returned home. All next day he wandered along the river carrying the crying child. Finally a man came who, hearing his story, offered to help him. The man told Beaver-foot, ""Wait by the pool and, when the hiintcabiit comes, tell it that you want to see your sister once more, and you want to see her entire body. "" The man made a hiding place at the edge of the pool. The hiintcabiit appeared at daybreak, and the man speared it as it raised the girl fully into view. As the monster jumped back, the woman was thrown on the bank. Beaver-foot carried her back and put her in the sweathouse. He said, ""Come out, my sister"" four times, and she came out alive. Some time later when the men were away, River-woman said to Crow-woman, ""Let us go swinging. "" Crow-woman agreed, and when they reached the pool, River-woman held Crow-woman under the water until she was dead. Then she threw the body into the pool, saying, ""Here is your food, my grandfather. "" When her husband returned, she told him what she had done. ""It is well,"" he told her, but she saw that he mourned for his wife. Next morning the husband noticed that the waters were rising, and he told the others. Beaver-foot said to them, ""Give me black, yellow, white, and red paint, and go to the top of the tallest mountain. "" They went, and he caused the tent to reach the top of the mountain before them. He followed slowly. Four times the water nearly reached him, he hurried on a ways, and then he dallied again. At last he reached the tent. The water rose to the pegs of the tent. Beaver-foot put black paint on his right foot, yellow on this right shoulder, white on his left shoulder, and red on his left foot. Then he stretched out his right foot, right arm, left arm, and left foot, successively to the four directions, and the water retreated before them. Fish, turtles, frogs, and other water animals were left lying on the newly exposed land. Beaver-foot said, ""Springs, rivers, streams, and lakes will occur where those are.

He called to Kisha Manido for help, who commanded the waters to stop. Seeing water everywhere, Manabush called to Otter to dive down and bring up some earth. Otter tried but drowned before reaching bottom. Mink failed similarly. Then Manabush called on Muskrat, who also returned drowned but had some mud in his paw. Manabush blew on Muskrat to return him to life. Then he took the earth, rubbed it between his hands, and threw it on the water, thus creating a new earth. Manabush told Muskrat that his tribe would always be numerous. He gave the skin of the Gray Bear chief to Badger and kept the skin of the White Bear chief.","Manabush wanted to punish the evil manidoes, the Ana maqkiu who had
killed his brother Wolf. He invented the ball game and asked the
Thunderers to play against the Ana maqkiu, who appeared from the
ground as bears. After the first day of play, Manabush made himself
into a pine tree near where the manidoes played. When they returned
the next morning, the manidoes were suspicious of the tree, so the
sent for Grizzly Bear to claw it and Serpent to strangle and bite
it. Manabush withstood these attacks, allaying their suspicion. When
the ball play took everyone else far away, Manabush shot and wounded
the two Bear chiefs with arrows and then ran away. The underground Ana
maqkiu soon came back, saw the wounded Bear chiefs, and called for a
flood from the earth. Badger hid Manabush in the earth, so the Ana
maqkiu gave up the search just as the water was starting to fill
Badger's burrow. The underground people took their chiefs to a wigwam
and sent for an old woman to heal them. Manabush followed, took the
old woman's skin and disguised himself in it. He entered the wigwam,
killed the two chiefs, and took the bear skins. The Ana maqkiu at once
pursued; water poured out of the earth in many places. Manabush
climbed a great pine tree on the highest mountain. When the waters

To stave off starvation one hard winter, they went hunting and came across the track of a moose. Wis-kay-tchach and the old wolf stopped to smoke while the two young wolves hunted the moose, but they didn't return, so the older two went after them. They found that the young wolves had eaten all of the moose. Wis made a fire, and when he had done so, the moose was restored again, already cut up. The young wolves divided the spoils into four, but one of them retained the tongue and upper lip. Wis grumbled, and the young wolves gave the delicacies to him. They made marrow fat, but soon this was also eaten, and they began to hunger again. They separated, with Wis and one young wolf hunting together. The wolf killed some deer, brought them home in his stomach, disgorged them on his arrival, and told his uncle that he could catch no more. Wis spent the night setting enchantments. In the morning, he told his nephew to go hunting, but warned him to throw a stick over every valley and hollow place before jumping over, or some evil would befall him. The wolf, following a deer, forgot this warning, jumped a hollow, and fell into a river where he was killed and devoured by water lynxes. Wis followed when his nephew didn't return. When he came upon the river, he guessed what had happened, and this was confirmed when a kingfisher told him it saw the wolf skin serving as a door mat of the water lynxes. The bird also told him that the water lynxes often come ashore, and Wis must turn himself into a stump close by to get his revenge. In gratitude, Wis began to put a ruff around the bird's neck, but the bird flew off before Wis could finish, which is why kingfishers have only part of a ruff at the back of their head. Wis returned to his camp to prepare; among other things, he provided a large canoe and in it embarked all animals that could not swim. He returned to the area of the lynxes before daybreak, transformed himself into a stump, and waited. The black one crawled out of the water, then the gray one. Then the white one, who had killed the wolf, emerged, but it grew suspicious on seeing the stump. It sent frogs and snakes to try to pull it down, but Wis kept himself upright. The lynx, suspicions lulled, went to sleep. Wis returned to normal shape and, though warned to shoot the lynx's shadow, forgot and shot its body. He shot a second arrow at the shadow, wounding the animal, but the lynx escaped into the river, which then overflowed and flooded the whole country. Wis escaped in his canoe and began rescuing the animals which could swim only a short time. Wis then tied a string around the leg of a loon and told it to dive for some earth, assuring it that he could restore it to life if it drowned. When the line ceased to play out, Wis hauled up the drowned loon, which, when restored to life, said that it had found no bottom. Wis next send an otter, then a beaver on the same errand, with similar results. Finally he send a rat fastened to a stone, and the rat, when hauled up, had a little earth in its paws. He dried the earth and blew on it to expand it. He sent a wolf to explore it, but the wolf soon returned, saying it was too small. He blew on it a long time, then sent a crow to explore. The crow didn't return, so Wis decided the land was big enough and disembarked with all the animals.","The medicine man Wis-kay-tchach recognized all animals as his

ruff around the bird's neck, but the bird flew off before Wis could
finish, which is why kingfishers have only part of a ruff at the back
of their head. Wis returned to his camp to prepare; among other
things, he provided a large canoe and in it embarked all animals that
could not swim. He returned to the area of the lynxes before daybreak,
transformed himself into a stump, and waited. The black one crawled
out of the water, then the gray one. Then the white one, who had
killed the wolf, emerged, but it grew suspicious on seeing the
stump. It sent frogs and snakes to try to pull it down, but Wis kept
himself upright. The lynx, suspicions lulled, went to sleep. Wis
returned to normal shape and, though warned to shoot the lynx's
shadow, forgot and shot its body. He shot a second arrow at the
shadow, wounding the animal, but the lynx escaped into the river,
which then overflowed and flooded the whole country. Wis escaped in
his canoe and began rescuing the animals which could swim only a short
time. Wis then tied a string around the leg of a loon and told it to
dive for some earth, assuring it that he could restore it to life if
it drowned. When the line ceased to play out, Wis hauled up the
drowned loon, which, when restored to life, said that it had found no
bottom. Wis next send an otter, then a beaver on the same errand,
with similar results. Finally he send a rat fastened to a stone, and
the rat, when hauled up, had a little earth in its paws. He dried the
earth and blew on it to expand it. He sent a wolf to explore it, but
the wolf soon returned, saying it was too small. He blew on it a long
time, then sent a crow to explore. The crow didn't return, so Wis
decided the land was big enough and disembarked with all the
animals.","Frazer, 1919, 297-301; Roheim, 1952, 157; Kelsen, 1943,147.",56.1304,-106.3468,Americas,North America,Ontario & Manitoba,Canada,9/16/2021

They formed an island, which Nenebojo enlarged. He sent a raven to determine its size, but it didn't return.

The oldest wolf became distrustful of Wenebojo and decided they should leave him, but one wolf, who liked Wenebojo, stayed with him and hunted food for him, and Wenebojo considered him his nephew. One night, this wolf didn't return from hunting. Wenebojo followed his tracks the next day and saw that he had fallen into a river. The manidog, or spirits under the water, caused the wolf's death because there wouldn't be any wild animals left if Wenebojo had his own way. Wenebojo went to the bank of a lake where the manidog sometimes come out to sun themselves; he turned himself into a stump and waited four days. At last, the manidog came out to bask. A big snake was suspicious that the stump was Wenebojo, so he went and squeezed it four times, harder and harder each time, but Wenebojo withstood it, and the snake said it wasn't Wenebojo. When all the manidog were asleep, Wenebojo shot the two kings, wounding them. All the manidog rushed back into the water. Wenebojo followed the stream and came across a kingfisher, which said it was waiting for Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float by. Wenebojo had a string of beads that had belonged to his nephew, and he offered them to the bird with the secret intent of strangling it, but his hand slipped and the bird escaped with the beads, which is why the kingfisher's head is bushy and it has a necklace of white spots. Wenebojo went on and met an old lady carrying basswood bark. He told her he wasn't Wenebojo, and the old lady told him that they were laying out basswood to detect Wenebojo, and that she was doctoring the wounded kings. Wenebojo learned her song and her route; then he killed her, skinned her, and put on her skin. He had to shave off his calf muscles to make it fit. With this disguise, he got entrance into the king's house. He saw his nephew's skin hanging there, which made him angry. Two snakes on either side of the door watched him suspiciously, but he told them his medicine wouldn't work with them watching. He went to the kings and pushed his arrows deeper, killing them. He ran out, breaking through basswood strings in his escape. The manidog saw the basswood moving and sent water there. Wenebojo heard the water coming and ran for a hill. Soon the water came to the top of the hill, and he climbed a tall pine tree there. The water kept coming, and he told the pine tree to stretch itself to double its length. It did that four times but could not stretch more. The water stopped rising just short of Wenebojo's mouth. Wenebojo had to defecate, and the feces floated around his mouth. Wenebojo saw an otter and asked it to dive for some earth. The otter tried, but it drowned. Wenebojo blew on it, and it came back to life and told him that it hadn't seen anything. A beaver got farther but also failed. Next, the muskrat tried. It also floated up drowned, but Wenebojo found a grain of earth in each of its paws and in its mouth. He restored the muskrat to life, dried the grains in the sun, and threw them on the water, forming a small island. The three animals and Wenebojo went on the island, and Wenebojo took handfuls of dirt from the island and threw them around, making it bigger. Other animals came from the water to the island, too. Wenebojo asked a caribou to run around the island to test its size. The caribou soon returned and reported that the land wasn't big enough yet. Wenebojo threw more dirt far and wide and sent the caribou off again, but the caribou never came back. It got tired and stayed in the north. For a long time, Wenebojo travelled, having forgotten about his anger. But one day he happened to remember, and he sat crying. He threatened to pull up the four layers below the earth and pull down the four layers of the sky to get at the manidog there. The first manido from below the earth and the Great Spirit manido from the sky believed he would do that, and they invited him to meet with them, but he wouldn't come until they sent a white otter (seal?) as a messenger. Wenebojo didn't have any parents, so they created parents for him. The manido from the bottom formed a clay figure, shook his rattle and talked, and the figure came to life. It was an Indian woman. The Great Spirit put the last rib from the woman into a clay figure and likewise created a man. The manidog also told Wenebojo about the Medicine Dance. The people were meant to live forever, but Wenebojo's brother Nekajiwegizik hadn't been invited. He was the first person to die, and he decreed that everyone who lived on earth would have to follow his road to the other world.","Wenebojo travelled awhile with five wolves. The oldest
wolf became distrustful of Wenebojo and decided they should
leave him, but one wolf, who liked Wenebojo, stayed with
him and hunted food for him, and Wenebojo considered him
his nephew. One night, this wolf didn't return from
hunting. Wenebojo followed his tracks the next day and saw
that he had fallen into a river. The manidog, or
spirits under the water, caused the wolf's death because
there wouldn't be any wild animals left if Wenebojo had his
own way. Wenebojo went to the bank of a lake where the
manidog sometimes come out to sun themselves; he turned himself
into a stump and waited four days. At last, the manidog came
out to bask. A big snake was suspicious that the stump was Wenebojo,
so he went and squeezed it four times, harder and harder each time,
but Wenebojo withstood it, and the snake said it wasn't Wenebojo. When
all the manidog were asleep, Wenebojo shot the two kings,
wounding them. All the manidog rushed back into the
water. Wenebojo followed the stream and came across a kingfisher,
which said it was waiting for Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float
by. Wenebojo had a string of beads that had belonged to his nephew,
and he offered them to the bird with the secret intent of strangling
it, but his hand slipped and the bird escaped with the beads, which is
why the kingfisher's head is bushy and it has a necklace of white
spots. Wenebojo went on and met an old lady carrying basswood bark. He
told her he wasn't Wenebojo, and the old lady told him that they were
laying out basswood to detect Wenebojo, and that she was doctoring the
wounded kings. Wenebojo learned her song and her route; then he killed
her, skinned her, and put on her skin. He had to shave off his calf
muscles to make it fit. With this disguise, he got entrance into the

When they parted, one of the wolves stayed with him and hunted for him. Wenebojo had a dream that the manidog, evil underwater spirits who were jealous of him, would kill his nephew, so he told his nephew not to cross any streams. But the wolf tried to jump a stream while hunting and was captured and killed. Wenebojo knew what happened. He followed a river to a lake and found a kingfisher in a tree looking into the water, waiting for some of Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float by. Wenebojo offered it a string of beads if it would tell him what it knew. The bird described how the manidog sun themselves. Wenebojo intended to wring the bird's neck as he put on the beads, but the bird slipped away. That is why the kingfisher has ruffled feathers around its neck. Wenebojo prepared two arrows by rubbing them on the lips of women having their first menses. Then he turned himself to a stump by the lake and waited for the manidog to sun themselves. When they emerged, the king was suspicious of the stump and had a snake squeeze it and a bear claw it, but Wenebojo withstood these attacks. Wenebojo wished the manidog would go to sleep, and when they slept, he shot and wounded the king and the next to the king; then he ran away as the water was rising behind him. Woodchuck saved him by digging a shelter, which they stayed in two days until the water receded. Later, Wenebojo encountered an old woman carrying basswood bark. He assured her that he was not Wenebojo, and she told him that the bark would be used to detect Wenebojo when he touched it, that she was treating the wounded manidog, and that only she had eaten his nephew. With that, he killed her, put on her clothes, and wished himself to look like her. He went to the wigwam of the wounded manidog and killed them. As he ran away, he heard a roar of water behind him. He ran to a bluff; a pine tree there told Wenebojo to climb it, and the tree stretched higher, saving Wenebojo from the flood with his nose barely above water. Wenebojo asked loon to dive down to get some dirt, but the loon died in the attempt. Otter and beaver failed similarly. Muskrat, however, was able to get a few grains of dirt before he passed out. Wenebojo used this dirt to recreate land. He told a big bird to fly around it; the land would grow as it did so. When the bird returned in four days, he sent an eagle out to grow the land larger. Wenebojo cut up the body of the king manido and made a lake of fat from it. The animals that ate or touched it acquired fat in their bodies.","For a time, Wenebojo travelled with a pack of wolves which he

had eaten his nephew. With that, he killed her, put on her clothes,
and wished himself to look like her. He went to the wigwam of the
wounded manidog and killed them. As he ran away, he heard a
roar of water behind him. He ran to a bluff; a pine tree there told
Wenebojo to climb it, and the tree stretched higher, saving Wenebojo
from the flood with his nose barely above water. Wenebojo asked loon
to dive down to get some dirt, but the loon died in the attempt. Otter
and beaver failed similarly. Muskrat, however, was able to get a few
grains of dirt before he passed out. Wenebojo used this dirt to
recreate land. He told a big bird to fly around it; the land would
grow as it did so. When the bird returned in four days, he sent an
eagle out to grow the land larger. Wenebojo cut up the body of the
king manido and made a lake of fat from it. The animals that
ate or touched it acquired fat in their bodies.","For a time, Wenebojo travelled with a pack of wolves which he considered his nephews.

He followed a river to a lake and found a kingfisher in a tree looking into the water, waiting for some of Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float by. Wenebojo offered it a string of beads if it would tell him what it knew. The bird described how the manidog sun themselves. Wenebojo intended to wring the bird's neck as he put on the beads, but the bird slipped away. That is why the kingfisher has ruffled feathers around its neck. Wenebojo prepared two arrows by rubbing them on the lips of women having their first menses. Then he turned himself to a stump by the lake and waited for the manidog to sun themselves. When they emerged, the king was suspicious of the stump and had a snake squeeze it and a bear claw it, but Wenebojo withstood these attacks. Wenebojo wished the manidog would go to sleep, and when they slept, he shot and wounded the king and the next to the king; then he ran away as the water was rising behind him. Woodchuck saved him by digging a shelter, which they stayed in two days until the water receded. Later, Wenebojo encountered an old woman carrying basswood bark.

One winter, it snowed and snowed so much that only the tops of the tallest firs were visible. It was unbearable. All the animals left for the sky looking for heat. They knew that they had to hurry or perish from the cold. The squirrel, being the smallest, climbed to the top of one of those tall trees and made a hole in the sky by which he entered heaven.

He swam to the tree and seized the bag before the slow-moving bear had a chance to catch him. As the reindeer swam away with the heat, the bear launched his canoe and pursued. But just as he was about to catch the reindeer, his oar broke, and he could go no further.

It covered the earth with such intensity that it made all the snow melt. The water grew and grew into a flood which covered even the tallest mountains.

hiding and killed Mawo with axes. Mawo's mother knew he had been
killed, and she took his tail, which was still tied to the string, and
put it in coconut shell bowl.There the tail rotted, and the mother used this material like salt
to flavor the food she cooked. Mawo's sister was curious where the
favor came from. The mother said it was a bit of the
conventially-made salt that she used, but the daughter did not believe
her. Seeing her mother take something from the coconut shell once
while cooking, she later went to look in the bowl. When she did, a
small amount spilled on the ground. It grew larger and larger. The
mother fanned it in all directions, and the liquid grew more as she
fanned it. It was the sea. It would have covered the whole world,
but the mother said, ""Mawo, leave some land for the children and
grandchildren to live on."" That is why there are islands and
mainlands.","Slone, 2001, 2: 956-957.",-6.7478,155.6867,Oceania,Pacific,South Bougainville District,Papua New Guinea,9/16/2021

Later, they threw down another and saw that the flood had receded just a little. While they waited, two big masalai stones came and ground up the bones of all the people and animals from the village. Then two big chickens came and swept all the bones into the forest. As they did so, they said, ""Manag gu bar pu, manag gu bar pu,"" ""Where are you going? Nowhere, huh. "" Then the village was clean, and the two girls and two boys came down. The boys grew into men, and each married the other's sister. They are the origin of the clan called Rangai.","A big python once lived in a hole at the base of a tree. One day,
children came and played in the area of tree. The boys gathered
coconuts and threw them down. The python gathered them into its hole
where it slept. After a while, the boys noticed their coconuts
missing and, searching for them, found the python in its hole. They
ran back to their village and told the people there.The leaders were happy to hear about the big python. They took
ginger leaves, tied up the python with them, and carried it back to
the village. Then they told everyone to prepare for a big feast.
When the preparations were done, they slept.In the morning, they appointed two girls and their brothers to
watch over the python. When the people went away to get the food, the
python turned into a young man. He said, ""Don't be afraid, I am a
young man like you."" He asked for betel nuts and chewed betel with
them.He told the girls, ""If the men kill me, ask them to give you my
belly. If something happens, take the two boys and some fire and go
to the top of that coconut tree.""When the people returned in the afternoon, the girls told them that
the snake was a person. The men laughed at the girls and said they
probably dreamed it. Then they killed and butchered the python. The
girls took the snake's guts down to the river and washed them. They
found it was filled with traditional adornments such as the teeth of
dogs and flying foxes. They took these and adorned their two brothers
who had been with them when the snake became a man.In the afternoon, everyone came to eat. As they ate, a strong wind

Jamiliwolo found a pond where fishing was excellent, and he told nobody else about it. A crab and a turtle who lived in the pond noticed the fish disappearing and decided to do something about it. When next the fisherman came, they waited until he had caught three fish, and on the fourth cast, the crab took his line and tied it to a tree. When Jamiliwolo tried to pull his hook up, it would not come. It was his only hook, so he swam under the water looking to find and unsnag it. As he swam, though, the turtle came and dug its beak into the man's testicles. The man screamed, abandoned all thoughts of his hook, and ran towards his village. The turtle still hung, biting his testicles. Finally, one of the man's maternal kin killed the turtle with a knife and removed it. When the people prepared an earth oven to cook the turtle, Jamiliwolo's testicles bled freely. The blood flowed and became a lake, which came to submerge the entire village.

Curious about these plants which normally grow only in swamps and lakes, the villagers plucked the lilies, and water began shooting in torrents through holes where the plants had been.

sex.One day, a young man resting in the men's cult house overheard

moreso by the gossip. He later told his brother, and the two planned
a retribution. Taking valuable shells, a pig, a dog, and a chicken,
they canoed to the river home of the spirit crocodile Mendangumeli.

paddle, and they threw the shells and meat into the water.A small crocodile surfaced. It was Mendangumeli. The brothers

Mendangumeli into a net bag, whereupon he grew to his full, enormous
size. They paddled away and put him in a hole in the ground.People at the village were still playing the tug-of-war game.

water lily, which normally grows only in swamps, sprouted in the
middle of the waterhole where Mendangumeli resided. The villagers
were curious about it, and they pulled it up. From its broken stem a
torrent of water flowed forth.The two brothers, with their families and all their possessions,

The kangaroo, eagle-hawk, and goanna were the chiefs of the three respective groups, and their advisors were koala, crow, and tiger-snake. They met on Blue Mountain. Tiger-snake spoke first and proposed that the animals and birds, who could travel more readily, should relocate to another country. Kangaroo rose to introduce platypus, whose family far outnumbered any others, but the meeting was then adjourned for the day. On the second day, while the conference proceeded with crow taunting koala for his inability to find a solution, the frilled lizards decided to act on their own. They possessed the knowledge of rain-making, and they spread the word to all of their family to perform the rain ceremony during the week before the new moon. Thus would they destroy the over-numerous platypus family. They did their ceremonies repeatedly, and a great storm came, flooding the land. The frilled lizards had made shelters on mountains, and some animals managed to make their way there, but nearly all life was destroyed in the great flood. When the flood ended and the sun shone again, the kangaroo called animals together to discover how the platypus family had fared. But they could not find a single living platypus. Three years later, the cormorant told emu that he had seen a platypus beak impression along a river, but never saw a platypus. Because of the flood, the platypuses had decided that the animals, birds, and reptiles were their enemies and only moved about at night. The animals organized a search party, and carpet-snake eventually found a platypus home and reported its location back to the others. Kangaroo summoned all the tribes together, even the insect tribe. Fringed lizard was ejected for doing mischief; he has turned ugly because of the hate he dwells upon. The animals and birds found they were both related to the platypus family; even the reptiles found some relationship; and everyone agreed that the platypuses were an old race.

conference to determine what to do. The kangaroo, eagle-hawk, and
goanna were the chiefs of the three respective groups, and their
advisors were koala, crow, and tiger-snake. They met on Blue Mountain.
Tiger-snake spoke first and proposed that the animals and birds, who
could travel more readily, should relocate to another
country. Kangaroo rose to introduce platypus, whose family far
outnumbered any others, but the meeting was then adjourned for the
day. On the second day, while the conference proceeded with crow
taunting koala for his inability to find a solution, the frilled
lizards decided to act on their own. They possessed the knowledge of
rain-making, and they spread the word to all of their family to
perform the rain ceremony during the week before the new moon. Thus
would they destroy the over-numerous platypus family. They did their
ceremonies repeatedly, and a great storm came, flooding the land. The
frilled lizards had made shelters on mountains, and some animals
managed to make their way there, but nearly all life was destroyed in
the great flood. When the flood ended and the sun shone again, the
kangaroo called animals together to discover how the platypus family
had fared. But they could not find a single living platypus. Three
years later, the cormorant told emu that he had seen a platypus beak
impression along a river, but never saw a platypus. Because of the
flood, the platypuses had decided that the animals, birds, and
reptiles were their enemies and only moved about at night. The

she was a witch. A strong, handsome man was married to her two
daughters.The daughters argued and fought with their mother, and the man
sided with his wives. They kept food from her, and the old woman
became angry as well as hungry.Their camp was at the source of the Clarance River. At that time,
their water was contained in a pool called Dooloomi, in a hollow in
the rock. One day when the son-in-law was hunting and his wives were
out gathering food, Dirrangun drained all the water out of the pool
and hid it in a coolamon. For two or three days, the man and his
wives could find nothing to drink. Then the man found Dirrangun's
hidden coolamon. (Some say his dogs found it, and he noticed the
water dripping from their muzzles.)The son-in-law angrily thrust his spear through the container,
draining it. He made a heavy rain fall, and the Dooloomi pool began
filling again. When the creek began rising above its banks, Dirrangun
climbed into a fig tree next to the pool. But the water rose further
and swept away the tree with her in it, leaving a hollow where there
is a waterfall today.The water continued to increase, and the son-in-law cursed it to
make it unmanageable. Dirrangun sometimes would try to block the
water with outstretched legs, but each time the water would rise and
wash her further down.There is a fig tree downstream from Grafton which old men say
belongs to Dooloomi, and Dirrangun is still in that fig tree.","Jennifer Isaacs, Australian Dreaming: 40,000 Yearsof Aboriginal History (Sydney: Lansdowne Press, 1984), 116-118;variant, p. 119.",-22.5752,144.0848,Oceania,Pacific,Queensland,Australia,9/16/2021

Let's go live in the bush country.""""Wait, I'll splash out most of the water from the lake. Then trees
will grow, but there will still be some swamp, and we'll both be
happy.""But Majen's plan to drain the lake did not work. Then an
especially wet rainy season came, and the water rose and flooded all
the surrounding country. When Narek complained more, Majen said, ""You
can go if you want to, but this is my country, and I can't leave
it.""""I'll stay with you,"" Narek said, ""but you have to make me a canoe
so I can follow you while you swim.""Majen went to the other side of the lake looking for a tree to make
a canoe from. While he was gone, a big storm came, and the water rose
higher. Narek, surrounded by water, could not run away, so she went
into the hollow of a tree. The water rose higher and covered the
entrance to the hollow. Narek climbed higher in the hollow, but there
was no way out. Majen came back that night with the canoe he had
made, but he could not find Narek anywhere.""She must have drowned,"" he thought sadly, ""and I'll never see her
again."" He changed himself into the Black Duck and stayed living on
the lake.After long waiting, Narek also thought that the storm had drowned
her spouse. ""I don't want to be a woman any more,"" she said. She
changed herself into the Cockatoo and broke out of the hollow with her
bill.","Sreten Bozic and Alan Marshall, Aboriginal Myths(Melbourne: Gold Star Publications, 1972), 53-55.",-19.4914,132.551,Oceania,Pacific,Northern Territory,Australia,9/16/2021

the people in them. Some were carried out to sea; others settled in

ponds, of alligators and water animals, and bade him descend with the
clouds and report to the distinguished sage Lip-long. Lip-long had
seen ill omens while auguring with chicken bones and knew a calamity
was coming, so he was not surprised to hear the water-god tell him
that Ling-lawn, the storm god, would soon flood the earth and destroy
everything on it. Hkang-hkak told the sage to build a strong raft and
take a cow on it, but not to warn anyone else, not even his wife or
children. Lip-long sorrowfully bent to his task while even his family
mocked his seemingly futile work. Fearing the gods, he heeded the
order not to warn anyone. A few days after he finished the raft, the
flood came, rushing violently. Only Lip-long and the cow survived on
the waters. He grieved to see the bodies of his family. Thus the race
of Shans perished. Their spirits went to the mansions of heaven, were
refreshed by a meal of cold crab, and found the spirit land a festive
and charming place. Meanwhile, the stench of corpses filled the
earth. Ling-lawn sent serpents to devour them, but there were too many
to eat. In anger he wanted to destroy the snakes, but they escaped
into a cave. He sent 999,000 tigers, but they couldn't eat all the
corpses, either. More angry now, he hurled thunderbolts at the tigers,
but they too escaped into caves. Then he sent Hsen-htam and Hpa-hpai,
the gods of fire, who descended on their horses to one of only three
elevations of land. They sent a great conflagration of fire over the
entire earth. When he saw the fire coming, Lip-long killed the cow
with a stick, cut it open with his sword, and crawled in its
belly. There he found a gourd seed. The fire swept over the cow, and
Lip-long came out. He asked Hkang-hkak what to do, and the water god
told him to plant the gourd seed on a level plot of ground. He did
so. One gourd vine grew up a mountain and was scorched by the sun. One
vine ran downward and rotted and died from soaking in the water from
the flood. A third vine twined around bushes and trees. Ling-lawn
sent his gardener to care for it, and it bore great fruit. Then
Ling-lawn sent Sao-pang, god of the clear sky, to prepare the earth
for humans. Sao-pang dried what remained of the flood with waves of
heat. Ling-lawn broke open a gourd with a thunderbolt, and people
emerged from it to till the land. Another bolt broke open a gourd. The
Shans therein asked god what to do, and he told them to go and rule
many lands. Other gourds were broken open to release all kinds of
animals, rivers, and plants.","Long ago, the middle world, of many worlds beneath the sky, had no race of kings (the Shan). Animals emerged from bamboos which cracked open and went to live in deep forests. Hpi-pok and Hpi-mot came from heaven to Möng-hi on the Cambodia river and became the ancestors of the Shan. But a time came when they offered no sacrifices to their gods. Ling-lawn, the storm god, sent large cranes to devour the people, but there were too many people to eat all of them. He sent lions, but they could not eat all of the people either. He send snakes, but the people attacked and killed them. A great drought came for the first four months of the new year, and many people died of thirst and famine. But the storm-god had not finished his battle.

One day, there was a beautiful rainbow after a downpour, and Xiang followed it as he picked bamboo shoots. He saw an eagle clutch a tiny red snake. In pity for the snake, Xiang yelled and threw his basket at the eagle, which dropped the snake and flew away. Xiang saw the snake disappear in a flash of light, and a column of smoke drifted up the mountain. That night he dreamed that a golden dragon thanked him for saving the life of the dragon's daughter and told him to visit. Grandma Ya had the same dream, so they set out, with their grandchildren, across three mountain passes and up a long slope, as the dream had directed. A beautiful girl came and told them that she had gone out earlier, entranced by the rainbow, and Xiang had rescued her. She led them to an idyllic pond and invited them to settle there. They did, and they grew younger and stronger from eating the fish of the pool. After a year, Xiang went back to his village and invited the people to live up on Sun Mountain with him. They did so and lived happily for some time. But an evil man wasted fish, polluted the pond, and finally poisoned all the fish. One dying fish told Xiang to make it a corn-flour body, feed it for 81 days on dew, and make a wooden house for himself. He did so, and all the people except the evil man made wooden houses.

Bubo led his people to open the copper sluice gate of the heavenly river a crack, but Thunder God closed it tight and lifted heaven higher so the people couldn't come again. Bubo went to the Dragon King to demand water of him. Dragon King refused, but he was forced to release his stream when Bubo held him tight and the people plucked out almost all his beard. By the third year, this stream dried up. Bubo climbed the sun-moon tree on Mount Bachi to heaven to fight Thunder God. Qigao, one of the thunder soldiers, told Bubo that Thunder God was determined to kill people with drought and pointed out his location. Bubo caught him and made him promise to send rain in three days, but Thunder God went back on his promise. Qigao brought world that Thunder God was grinding his axe. Bubo put a slippery surface on his roof and instructed his wife and children to stand ready with clubs and a net. Thunder God came in a rainstorm and tried to land on Bubo's house but slipped off and was captured. Bubo imprisoned Thunder God in a granary, warning his family not to give him an ax or any water, but his children, Fuyi and his sister, were enticed to give him some indigo ink, and the moisture gave Thunder God the strength to escape. The children were angry that he had tricked them, but Thunder God promised that he would repay them by saving them from the flood that he would bring in a few days. He gave them one of his teeth and told them to plant it. They did so, and it grew into a vine with a giant gourd fruit. Fuyi and his sister scooped out the pith and entered it. Thunder God breached the dike holding back the river of heaven, and Dragon King, in revenge against Bubo's plucking his beard, released his lake water, too. The water rose over the mountains as high as heaven's ceiling. Bubo, though, rode the waves floating on an inverted umbrella. He made for the gate of heaven and attacked Thunder God, chopping off his feet. (Thunder God later replaced them with chicken feet. ) Thunder God, with the help of Dragon King, rapidly made the water subside so Bubo could not reach him. Bubo and his umbrella dropped from the sky and were smashed. Bubo's heart was thrown onto the ceiling of heaven and remains there as the planet Venus.

But as Son Tinh had all he wanted, he put the book away and thought no
more of it.Some time later, King Hung Vuong announced a contest for the hand
of his daughter, My Nuong, in marriage. The princess was so beautiful
that Son Tinh joined the hundreds of other suitors. Only two of the
suitors passed the contest -- Son Tinh and Thuy Tinh.The king determined on another test to choose between them. He
told them to bring him several rare and precious items, half of them
from Son Tinh's realm and half from Thuy Tinh's. Whoever brought the
gifts first would win the princess.Son Tinh, remembering the book of wishes, used it to obtain all the
items and delivered them the following morning. It took Thuy Tinh two
days to gather them all. So upset was he at losing, he forgot his
earlier gratitude for Son Tinh and used all his powers to attack him.
He gathered up all the water from the sky and ocean and sent them
against Son Tinh. Son Tinh, however, was able to keep his mountain
home above the reach of the waters.Thuy Tinh repeated the attack again the next year, bringing months
of rain and floods. And he has continued to do so every year. The
monsoons which hit the country are part of the continuing feud of the
Sea God against the Mountain God.","Alice M. Terada, Under the Starfruit Tree: Folktalesfrom Vietnam (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1989),49-53.",14.0583,108.2772,Asia,South East Asia,,Vietnam,9/16/2021

While young Gim was away from home once, robbers came to his house, murdered his father, and carried away his mother and all their treasure. Despite his youth, young Gim resolved to find the robbers and take revenge. He set out on a search. On the way, he heard shouts and found a boy fighting with a bear. He rushed to save the boy. The boy told him that his home and family had been destroyed by the same band of robbers and that he, too, was seeking revenge. They agreed to become sworn brothers. They set out together, but as they were crossing a river, a storm came and capsized their ferry. When Gim came to, a different boy, who happened to have been fishing nearby, was tending him, and there was no sign of his first friend. Gim learned that this boy was also a victim of the robbers, who had killed his father and mother and carried off his sister. So Gim proposed that they should become sworn brothers. The two set off together and came to another big river. As they crossed it, another storm came and sank their ferry. Gim's second companion was lost, and Gim was rescued by an old woman who lived on an island. She told him that the island was ruthlessly ruled by the chief of the robbers he was seeking. But Gim was bedridden and helpless from his injuries. One day, a messenger from the robber chief told the woman to send away the strange boy she had found. She instead let him stay in a small thatched hut by the river. A ship came by a few days later and anchored before the hut. A venerable old man on the ship recognized Gim and said he was there to rescue him. Gim went with him to his mountain retreat and studied magic with him. When Gim was sixteen, the old man sent him back to his homeland, saying, ""The robber chief is at war with the King, who is in great danger. You must go to his rescue. I shall meet you again in exactly three years. ""As Gim was heading home, a horse came to him. Gim guessed it was a dragon horse and mounted it. Before long, the horse stopped and pawed on the ground. Gim dug there and found a set of magic armor, spears, and swords. He took these up and rode on. He arrived at the King's castle when it was on the point of surrender. With his magic, he transformed himself and his horse to birds, flew over the enemy host to the King's castle, and returned to his proper form. ""Your majesty,"" he said, bowing low, ""I am the son of Minister Gim. Have no fear, I shall defeat the enemy. "" The delighted King conferred on him the rank of Great Marshal. Spying out the enemy in the form of a dog, Gim found a fearsome black face, the incarnation of a thousand-year-old bear, belching fire at the castle; a genii, the incarnation of a thousand-year-old fox, studying a book of astrology; a dwarf, the incarnation of a ten-thousand-year-old rat, whose swinging tail produced a flood that threatened to submerge the castle; and a giant which threw daggers of flame against the King's camp. Gim fought these with his magic, calling forth rain against the fire and a mountain to block the flood, but he was overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers. Gim and the King escaped to an island, but the astrologer discovered their location, and the dwarf created an even greater flood from its tail to submerge them. In a dream, a butterfly led Gim to a cavern in a distant mountain. There he found the first boy he had met, who had been studying strategy. He offered his help against the robbers.

In a dream, a butterfly led Gim to a cavern in a distant mountain. There he found the first boy he had met, who had been studying strategy. He offered his help against the robbers. With their magic, they reached the island in an instant and renewed the battle. But Gim's friend was killed and the island completely submerged by the flood. Gim and the King retreated to a second island, but soon it too was nearly submerged. Again in a dream a crow led Gim to a cavern in another mountain, where he met his second companion, also practicing the crafts of war. He too returned to fight with Gim, but he too was killed in battle. Gim and the King fled to another island. When it, too, was nearly flooded, they went on the ship to open sea. There, the three years having elapsed, Gim's mentor came to him on the ship. As Gim's training had not been completed and the situation was desperate, the old man undertook a rescue. He recited a magical hymn which called down lightning on the enemy, and soon they were all killed. Gim and the old man went to the enemy's island. There Gim found his mother and the sister of his second friend, whom he married soon afterwards. They returned home with the King.","Long ago there lived a Minister Gim who had a son. While young Gim
was away from home once, robbers came to his house, murdered his
father, and carried away his mother and all their treasure. Despite
his youth, young Gim resolved to find the robbers and take revenge.
He set out on a search.On the way, he heard shouts and found a boy fighting with a bear.
He rushed to save the boy. The boy told him that his home and family
had been destroyed by the same band of robbers and that he, too, was
seeking revenge. They agreed to become sworn brothers.They set out together, but as they were crossing a river, a storm
came and capsized their ferry. When Gim came to, a different boy, who
happened to have been fishing nearby, was tending him, and there was
no sign of his first friend. Gim learned that this boy was also a
victim of the robbers, who had killed his father and mother and
carried off his sister. So Gim proposed that they should become sworn
brothers.The two set off together and came to another big river. As they
crossed it, another storm came and sank their ferry. Gim's second
companion was lost, and Gim was rescued by an old woman who lived on
an island. She told him that the island was ruthlessly ruled by the
chief of the robbers he was seeking. But Gim was bedridden and
helpless from his injuries.One day, a messenger from the robber chief told the woman to send
away the strange boy she had found. She instead let him stay in a
small thatched hut by the river. A ship came by a few days later and
anchored before the hut. A venerable old man on the ship recognized
Gim and said he was there to rescue him. Gim went with him to his
mountain retreat and studied magic with him.When Gim was sixteen, the old man sent him back to his homeland,
saying, ""The robber chief is at war with the King, who is in great
danger. You must go to his rescue. I shall meet you again in exactly
three years.""As Gim was heading home, a horse came to him. Gim guessed it was a
dragon horse and mounted it. Before long, the horse stopped and pawed
on the ground. Gim dug there and found a set of magic armor, spears,
and swords. He took these up and rode on.He arrived at the King's castle when it was on the point of
surrender. With his magic, he transformed himself and his horse to
birds, flew over the enemy host to the King's castle, and returned to
his proper form. ""Your majesty,"" he said, bowing low, ""I am the son
of Minister Gim. Have no fear, I shall defeat the enemy."" The
delighted King conferred on him the rank of Great Marshal.Spying out the enemy in the form of a dog, Gim found a fearsome
black face, the incarnation of a thousand-year-old bear, belching fire
at the castle; a genii, the incarnation of a thousand-year-old fox,
studying a book of astrology; a dwarf, the incarnation of a
ten-thousand-year-old rat, whose swinging tail produced a flood that
threatened to submerge the castle; and a giant which threw daggers of
flame against the King's camp. Gim fought these with his magic,
calling forth rain against the fire and a mountain to block the flood,
but he was overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers.Gim and the King escaped to an island, but the astrologer

He was an unusual baby, for he ate solid food and grew at a phenomenal rate. When but a month old, he asked his foster-father to make a pack-carrier for him to carry firewood with. His father made one of corn stalks, which the boy rejected as useless, and he likewise rejected one made of wood, so the father had one made of iron. The son took this, and a little later the father was astounded to see him carrying an immense pile of wood back from the mountains. The son continued to grow in strength, and he earned the nickname ""Iron-shoes"" for the shoes he wore in his work. He left on a journey and met others along the way. First he met Nose-wind, a man whose breath while snoring was so strong it caused a nearby tree repeatedly to fall and rise. They became sworn brothers and travelled together. Next they met Long-rake, who caused a mountain to become a level field with his rake. The three next met Waterfall, who created a river by making water. All four became sworn brothers. Coming at nightfall to a big house with a tile roof, they knocked and requested something to eat. An old woman invited them inside, led them to a room with stone walls, and brought them supper. But the food was human flesh, which they did not eat, and they heard the woman lock them in. As they pretended to sleep, they heard the woman's four sons come. The family's conversation made it clear that they were tigers in disguise who meant to cook and eat the four brothers. Soon the four brothers felt the stone floor getting hot; the tigers had lit a fire beneath it to roast them. But Nose-wind kept the room cool by his blowing, and the tigers were surprised to find the brothers unharmed when they opened the door later. Next morning the woman suggested that the four brothers have a wood-cutting contest with her four sons, the losers to be put to death. So the four brothers went out, pulled up trees by their roots, and threw them down by the house for the tigers to pile up. The old woman saw that her sons were in danger of losing, so she reversed the tasks; the tigers chopped wood while the brothers stacked. But the brothers worked so fast that they had to wait for more wood to be brought down. Fearing defeat, the old woman set fire to the stack of wood while the four brothers were standing on it. Her sons saw the fire and came back to watch their rival's plight. The four brothers, though, soon worked out a plan. Waterfall made water which not only put out the fire, but created a flood that submerged the others up to their necks, though the brothers were safe upon the pile of logs. In the flood, the woman and her sons changed to their normal tiger shape. Nose-wind blew on the water with his cold breath, instantly turning it to ice and killing all the tigers. Their heads and forepaws still showed above the surface. Iron-shoes skated out on the ice and broke off these parts when he kicked them. Finally, Long-rake broke up the ice with his rake and scattered it far and wide, so no trace remained of the flood.","A man with no son once found an abandoned baby boy and took him in.

Their heads and forepaws still showed above the surface. Iron-shoes
skated out on the ice and broke off these parts when he kicked them.
Finally, Long-rake broke up the ice with his rake and scattered it far
and wide, so no trace remained of the flood.","Zong In-Sob, Folk Tales from Korea (London:Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd., 1952), 162-166.",35.9078,127.7669,Asia,East Asia,,Korea,9/16/2021

Although she was unusually beautiful and intelligent, she rejected all his choices. ""Father,"" she said, ""I am not interested in money and status. I want a man who is honest and brave. ""The Dragon King then directed his couriers to search for such a man. One day, General Eel reported that he had found a worthy candidate. His name was Ah Er, and he lived in poverty with his brother on a river bend, making a living as a hunter. His reputation for honesty and bravery was known far and wide. The Dragon King was uncomfortable with the idea of marrying his daughter outside the Aquatic Family, and he was doubtful that the man's character was as reported. The princess was delighted by the prospect, though, so the King decided to follow a plan suggested by Counselor Lobster. That night, Ah Er dreamed that an old man came and told him that a maiden awaited him by the river, and that he should ask her hand in marriage. Ah Er awoke and told his dream to his older brother Ah Da. Ah Da listened with envy and replied, ""You can't take such a dream seriously. Go back to sleep. ""Ah Er went back to sleep, and Ah Da sneaked out and went to the river. Ah Er woke up again, wondered at his brother's absence, and thought the dream might be true, so he hurried to the river, too. He arrived shortly after Ah Da. There, in the moonlight, a beautiful maiden lay on a rock with her hair trailing in the river. Both brothers went to her and asked her hand in marriage. She looked from one to the other and said, ""Whom shall I choose? Which of you is most honest and brave?""""I am,"" they both replied together. ""Well, then. Whichever of you is the most honest and brave can fetch a luminous pearl which shines at night. It is in the keeping of the Dragon King in the Eastern Sea. I will give each of you a magic clasp which will allow you to journey into the sea. The one who brings me the pearl will become my husband. ""Ah Er set off on foot, and Ah Da borrowed a horse to ride. They journeyed to the east for many days over many miles. One day, Ah Da arrived at a flooded village. A torrential rain lasting almost ten days had submerged the fields and many houses; the people had escaped to the mountainside. The water showed no sign of retreating, and the people were worried that their waterlogged crops would die. As Ah Da passed, he heard the people saying that the only way to bail out the water was to borrow the Golden Dipper from the Dragon King. ""I'm on my way to the Dragon King now!"" he said. Since he had just finished his last bread when he came there, he offered to borrow the Golden Dipper in exchange for some bread. The people, greatly cheered, agreed, and pooled their food to give him, and they helped him on his way across the river. Two days later, Ah Er arrived at the village. He had finished his bread days ago and had been living on wild animals that he hunted. He spent a full day helping the villagers salvage their belongings from the flood, and he learned of their need for the Dragon King's Golden Dipper. ""I'm going to the Dragon King anyway,"" he said, ""How about I borrow it for you while I am there?"" The villagers were surprised to meet someone else who was off to meet the Dragon King, but they readily agreed. Ah Er promised to bring the Dipper, and he swam across the river to go on his way. When Ah Er reached the shore of the Eastern Sea, he found Ah Da lingering there. The waves of the sea were huge and violent, effortlessly sweeping even large boulders across the beach. Ah Da had been too frightened to risk the waves, but Ah Er entered them without hesitation. His magical water-cleaving clasp caused the water to separate before him, opening a wide passageway into the sea. Seeing this, Ah Da nervously followed. They soon arrived at the palace of the Dragon King. The King welcomed them and invited them to his treasure house. The two brothers were amazed at the dazzling sight. The large room was filled with every kind of treasure, covering the tables and walls everywhere they looked. ""Take whatever you like,"" the Dragon King said. ""The only rule is that each of you may take only one piece. ""Ah Da was attracted by a shelf full of luminous pearls, the largest of which shone with a light that filled the entire room. Thinking to win the hand of the maiden by the river, he put it in his bag. He wanted to take many of the other treasures, too, but the doorkeeper pushed him out. Ah Er saw the luminous pearls, too, but remembering his promise to the villagers, he took only the Golden Dipper. The two brothers then left. When they reached the shore, Ah Da mounted his horse and hurried on ahead. The people of the flooded village crowded around him when he approached, anxious for the Golden Dipper. ""The Dragon King refused to let me borrow it,"" he lied, and he went on his way. The next day, Ah Er arrived at the village and shouted to the people that he had the Golden Dipper. The people joined to help him bail out the flood. With just three scoops, the floodwater was removed, revealing in the process a large oyster. They opened the oyster and found a large black pearl. As the grateful villagers had nothing else of value, they gave the pearl to Ah Er as a reward and a remembrance. Ah Da arrived home first, and he lost no time bringing his pearl to the maiden on the river. He pressed the shining stone into her hands and again asked her to marry him. She, however, insisted that they wait to see the pearl by night. When Ah Da returned that night, though, he was dismayed to find that the pearl had lost its luster. In exasperation he threw down the pearl and crushed it underfoot. A vile, smelly liquid oozed from it. Ah Er arrived three days later. He went to the maiden and said, ""Forgive me, miss, but I was not able to get the pearl you wanted. """"But what is that in your pack?"" she asked. ""Just an ordinary pearl given to me as a gift,"" he said, taking it out. Ah Da sneered at how dark it was. ""Even the stones in the river shine more than that,"" he said. ""Let us wait to see it at night,"" the maiden said. That night, when Ah Er removed the pearl from his pack, it shone brighter than the moon. The maiden took it an threw it in the air. Ah Er, dazzled by the light, closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again, there before him was a golden palace, with the luminous pearl set atop its roof.

Ah Da had been too frightened to risk the waves, but Ah Er entered them without hesitation. His magical water-cleaving clasp caused the water to separate before him, opening a wide passageway into the sea. Seeing this, Ah Da nervously followed. They soon arrived at the palace of the Dragon King. The King welcomed them and invited them to his treasure house. The two brothers were amazed at the dazzling sight. The large room was filled with every kind of treasure, covering the tables and walls everywhere they looked. ""Take whatever you like,"" the Dragon King said. ""The only rule is that each of you may take only one piece. ""Ah Da was attracted by a shelf full of luminous pearls, the largest of which shone with a light that filled the entire room. Thinking to win the hand of the maiden by the river, he put it in his bag. He wanted to take many of the other treasures, too, but the doorkeeper pushed him out. Ah Er saw the luminous pearls, too, but remembering his promise to the villagers, he took only the Golden Dipper. The two brothers then left. When they reached the shore, Ah Da mounted his horse and hurried on ahead. The people of the flooded village crowded around him when he approached, anxious for the Golden Dipper. ""The Dragon King refused to let me borrow it,"" he lied, and he went on his way. The next day, Ah Er arrived at the village and shouted to the people that he had the Golden Dipper. The people joined to help him bail out the flood. With just three scoops, the floodwater was removed, revealing in the process a large oyster. They opened the oyster and found a large black pearl. As the grateful villagers had nothing else of value, they gave the pearl to Ah Er as a reward and a remembrance. Ah Da arrived home first, and he lost no time bringing his pearl to the maiden on the river. He pressed the shining stone into her hands and again asked her to marry him. She, however, insisted that they wait to see the pearl by night. When Ah Da returned that night, though, he was dismayed to find that the pearl had lost its luster. In exasperation he threw down the pearl and crushed it underfoot. A vile, smelly liquid oozed from it. Ah Er arrived three days later. He went to the maiden and said, ""Forgive me, miss, but I was not able to get the pearl you wanted. """"But what is that in your pack?"" she asked. ""Just an ordinary pearl given to me as a gift,"" he said, taking it out. Ah Da sneered at how dark it was. ""Even the stones in the river shine more than that,"" he said. ""Let us wait to see it at night,"" the maiden said. That night, when Ah Er removed the pearl from his pack, it shone brighter than the moon. The maiden took it an threw it in the air. Ah Er, dazzled by the light, closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again, there before him was a golden palace, with the luminous pearl set atop its roof. The maiden and Ah Er, hand in hand, walked into the palace to their wedding. Ah Da tried to follow but was stopped by the palace guards. ""Father,"" she said, ""I am not interested in money and status. I want a man who is honest and brave. ""The Dragon King then directed his couriers to search for such a man. One day, General Eel reported that he had found a worthy candidate. His name was Ah Er, and he lived in poverty with his brother on a river bend, making a living as a hunter. His reputation for honesty and bravery was known far and wide. The Dragon King was uncomfortable with the idea of marrying his daughter outside the Aquatic Family, and he was doubtful that the man's character was as reported. The princess was delighted by the prospect, though, so the King decided to follow a plan suggested by Counselor Lobster. That night, Ah Er dreamed that an old man came and told him that a maiden awaited him by the river, and that he should ask her hand in marriage. Ah Er awoke and told his dream to his older brother Ah Da. Ah Da listened with envy and replied, ""You can't take such a dream seriously. Go back to sleep. ""Ah Er went back to sleep, and Ah Da sneaked out and went to the river. Ah Er woke up again, wondered at his brother's absence, and thought the dream might be true, so he hurried to the river, too. He arrived shortly after Ah Da. There, in the moonlight, a beautiful maiden lay on a rock with her hair trailing in the river. Both brothers went to her and asked her hand in marriage. She looked from one to the other and said, ""Whom shall I choose? Which of you is most honest and brave?""""I am,"" they both replied together. ""Well, then. Whichever of you is the most honest and brave can fetch a luminous pearl which shines at night. It is in the keeping of the Dragon King in the Eastern Sea.

""Ah Er set off on foot, and Ah Da borrowed a horse to ride. They journeyed to the east for many days over many miles. One day, Ah Da arrived at a flooded village. A torrential rain lasting almost ten days had submerged the fields and many houses; the people had escaped to the mountainside. The water showed no sign of retreating, and the people were worried that their waterlogged crops would die. As Ah Da passed, he heard the people saying that the only way to bail out the water was to borrow the Golden Dipper from the Dragon King. ""I'm on my way to the Dragon King now!"" he said. Since he had just finished his last bread when he came there, he offered to borrow the Golden Dipper in exchange for some bread. The people, greatly cheered, agreed, and pooled their food to give him, and they helped him on his way across the river. Two days later, Ah Er arrived at the village. He had finished his bread days ago and had been living on wild animals that he hunted. He spent a full day helping the villagers salvage their belongings from the flood, and he learned of their need for the Dragon King's Golden Dipper. ""I'm going to the Dragon King anyway,"" he said, ""How about I borrow it for you while I am there?""

Thinking to win the hand of the maiden by the river, he put it in his bag. He wanted to take many of the other treasures, too, but the doorkeeper pushed him out. Ah Er saw the luminous pearls, too, but remembering his promise to the villagers, he took only the Golden Dipper. The two brothers then left. When they reached the shore, Ah Da mounted his horse and hurried on ahead. The people of the flooded village crowded around him when he approached, anxious for the Golden Dipper. ""The Dragon King refused to let me borrow it,"" he lied, and he went on his way. The next day, Ah Er arrived at the village and shouted to the people that he had the Golden Dipper. The people joined to help him bail out the flood. With just three scoops, the floodwater was removed, revealing in the process a large oyster. They opened the oyster and found a large black pearl. As the grateful villagers had nothing else of value, they gave the pearl to Ah Er as a reward and a remembrance. Ah Da arrived home first, and he lost no time bringing his pearl to the maiden on the river. He pressed the shining stone into her hands and again asked her to marry him. She, however, insisted that they wait to see the pearl by night. When Ah Da returned that night, though, he was dismayed to find that the pearl had lost its luster. In exasperation he threw down the pearl and crushed it underfoot. A vile, smelly liquid oozed from it. Ah Er arrived three days later. He went to the maiden and said, ""Forgive me, miss, but I was not able to get the pearl you wanted. """"But what is that in your pack?"" she asked. ""Just an ordinary pearl given to me as a gift,"" he said, taking it out. Ah Da sneered at how dark it was. ""Even the stones in the river shine more than that,"" he said. ""Let us wait to see it at night,"" the maiden said. That night, when Ah Er removed the pearl from his pack, it shone brighter than the moon. The maiden took it an threw it in the air. Ah Er, dazzled by the light, closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again, there before him was a golden palace, with the luminous pearl set atop its roof. The maiden and Ah Er, hand in hand, walked into the palace to their wedding. Ah Da tried to follow but was stopped by the palace guards.","The Dragon King had difficulty finding a husband for his daughter.
Although she was unusually beautiful and intelligent, she rejected all
his choices.""Father,"" she said, ""I am not interested in money and status. I
want a man who is honest and brave.""The Dragon King then directed his couriers to search for such a
man. One day, General Eel reported that he had found a worthy
candidate. His name was Ah Er, and he lived in poverty with his
brother on a river bend, making a living as a hunter. His reputation
for honesty and bravery was known far and wide.The Dragon King was uncomfortable with the idea of marrying his
daughter outside the Aquatic Family, and he was doubtful that the
man's character was as reported. The princess was delighted by the
prospect, though, so the King decided to follow a plan suggested by
Counselor Lobster.That night, Ah Er dreamed that an old man came and told him that a
maiden awaited him by the river, and that he should ask her hand in
marriage. Ah Er awoke and told his dream to his older brother Ah Da.
Ah Da listened with envy and replied, ""You can't take such a dream
seriously. Go back to sleep.""Ah Er went back to sleep, and Ah Da sneaked out and went to the
river. Ah Er woke up again, wondered at his brother's absence, and
thought the dream might be true, so he hurried to the river, too. He
arrived shortly after Ah Da.There, in the moonlight, a beautiful maiden lay on a rock with her
hair trailing in the river. Both brothers went to her and asked her
hand in marriage. She looked from one to the other and said, ""Whom
shall I choose? Which of you is most honest and brave?""""I am,"" they both replied together.""Well, then. Whichever of you is the most honest and brave can
fetch a luminous pearl which shines at night. It is in the keeping of
the Dragon King in the Eastern Sea. I will give each of you a magic
clasp which will allow you to journey into the sea. The one who
brings me the pearl will become my husband.""Ah Er set off on foot, and Ah Da borrowed a horse to ride. They
journeyed to the east for many days over many miles. One day, Ah Da
arrived at a flooded village. A torrential rain lasting almost ten
days had submerged the fields and many houses; the people had escaped
to the mountainside. The water showed no sign of retreating, and the
people were worried that their waterlogged crops would die.As Ah Da passed, he heard the people saying that the only way to
bail out the water was to borrow the Golden Dipper from the Dragon
King. ""I'm on my way to the Dragon King now!"" he said. Since he had
just finished his last bread when he came there, he offered to borrow
the Golden Dipper in exchange for some bread. The people, greatly
cheered, agreed, and pooled their food to give him, and they helped
him on his way across the river.Two days later, Ah Er arrived at the village. He had finished his
bread days ago and had been living on wild animals that he hunted. He
spent a full day helping the villagers salvage their belongings from
the flood, and he learned of their need for the Dragon King's Golden
Dipper. ""I'm going to the Dragon King anyway,"" he said, ""How about I
borrow it for you while I am there?"" The villagers were surprised to
meet someone else who was off to meet the Dragon King, but they
readily agreed. Ah Er promised to bring the Dipper, and he swam
across the river to go on his way.When Ah Er reached the shore of the Eastern Sea, he found Ah Da
lingering there. The waves of the sea were huge and violent,
effortlessly sweeping even large boulders across the beach. Ah Da had
been too frightened to risk the waves, but Ah Er entered them without
hesitation. His magical water-cleaving clasp caused the water to
separate before him, opening a wide passageway into the sea. Seeing
this, Ah Da nervously followed.They soon arrived at the palace of the Dragon King. The King
welcomed them and invited them to his treasure house. The two
brothers were amazed at the dazzling sight. The large room was filled
with every kind of treasure, covering the tables and walls everywhere
they looked. ""Take whatever you like,"" the Dragon King said. ""The

devastation until the Lord Brahma's sleep is over. You will be
thoroughly advised and favored by me."" After instructing the King
thus, the Lord left, and the King began to wait for the appointed
time, meditating on the feet of the Lord in the form of a fish.Incessant water from giant clouds swelled the ocean so that it
overflowed the land. As Satyavrata remembered the orders of the Lord,
he saw a boat coming toward him. He gathered the herbs and seeds and,
with the seven saintly brahmanas, boarded the boat. While the King
meditated upon the Lord, a large golden fish with one horn appeared.
Following its instructions, Satyavrata anchored the boat to the fish's
horn, using the serpent Vasuki as a rope. Then he began offering
prayers to the Lord, declaring his acceptance of the Supreme Lord as
the supreme spiritual master.After Satyavrata had prayed, the Lord in the form of Matsya, while
moving on the waters, explained the Absolute Truth to him. The Lord
Vishnu explained all of the timeless Vedic literatures.At the end of the inundation, the Lord killed the demon Hayagriva
and delivered all the Vedic literatures to Lord Brahma when he
awoke.King Satyavrata, illuminated with all Vedic knowledge, took birth
in this age as Vaivasvata Manu, the son of the sun-god.","This version of the story of Manu is from the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Bhagavata Purana.","This version of the story of Manu is from the Srimad

Being of a kind and generous nature, he tiptoed past so as not to wake her. Just then, a gray crane swooped down and seized the snake. The snake screamed for help, and Hailibu quickly set an arrow in his bow and shot at the escaping crane, which dropped the snake and flew away.

Hailibu replied, ""They are fine, but not useful for a hunter such as myself. May I have the precious stone in your mouth as a remembrance?"" The Dragon King hesitated but handed over the stone. As Hailibu was leaving, the little white snake warned him again not to reveal anything he learned by means of the stone. ""Danger will befall you if you do. Do not forget this!""Hunting became easy for Hailibu after that, for he was able to hear all about the locations and plans of the birds and animals.

rubble shot into the air. She shouted in an awful cry, ""Father,
mother, and all my kinfolk! Children of Mboto, come out."" At
that, the old spirits came in great number from the top of Mt. Kenya,
carrying goats, cattle, food, and beer. There was a long, loud horn
blast, followed by the heavy beating of a drum. Thunder and lightning
filled the country, and a frightful hail storm covered the ground with
hail stones. As the people sought shelter in huts and caves, the old
spirits poured beer on the earth, and the country was quickly turned
into a lake. The old spirits went straight to Mwenendega's house.
They surrounded him and carried him, his wife, and his children to the
top of Mt. Kenya and buried them there.When people make a sacrifice now, they turn to Mount Kenya and look
at the white spot there, lest a misfortune happen to them as it did to
those others, long, long ago.","Roger D. Abrahams, African Folktales (New York:Pantheon, 1983), 336-338.",-0.0236,37.9062,Africa,Eastern Africa,,Kenya,9/16/2021

He held high the calabash and prayed, ""Lord Obassi, let not your gift for our joy turn to our hurt. ""The water went down, making broad rivers and small streams for itself.

the sky, along with his wife Ejaw (Wildcat). They were the first people
on earth.At that time, there was no water on earth. Etim 'Ne and his wife stayed
for seven days, with only the juice from plantain stems to drink and cook
with. Then Etim 'Ne went to the sky, to the house of the god Obassi Osaw,
and asked him for some water to bring back.Obassi Osaw gave Etim 'Ne a calabash with seven clear stones inside. He
said, ""Whenever you open this, let no one else be present. When you want
water, take one of these and throw it on the ground.""Etim 'Ne thanked Lord Obassi and returned to earth. When he reached an
area near where he had begun a farm, he made a hole and placed one of the
stones in it. Water welled from the hole, creating a broad lake.In time, seven sons were born to the couple, and then seven
daughters. When the daughters had all matured and were sent to the
fatting-house, Etim 'Ne told his sons to build their compounds, and he
would give a daughter to each son. ""Do not care that she is your
sister,"" he said. ""Marry her, for there is no one else to become your
wife.""The eldest son lived near Etim 'Ne, and Etim 'Ne gave a river or
lake to each of the other sons. After a year, each of the girls had
seven children, three girls and four boys. Etim 'Ne was very
happy.The seven sons were all hunters. Three of them were good and
shared their meat with Etim 'Ne, but four were bad and hid the meat to
keep for themselves.When Etim 'Ne saw this, he took away the rivers from the four bad
sons. These were very sad; they consulted together and brought palm
wine to their father, asking what they had done to cause him to take
away their water. Etim 'Ne answered that they had not shared their
meat with him, but he forgave them and returned their streams.After another year, the sons had children again. When they grew
up, Etim 'Ne sent them to different places to build their houses.
When they were ready to leave, he said to them, ""Take seven smooth
stones from the streams of your fathers, some small and some big as
the palm of your hand. Each of you go in a different direction and
lay a stone on the ground. Walk on again and do the same, until all
the stones are used. Small streams will come from where you place
small stones, and big rivers from the big stones.""All the sons did as they were told except one, who filled a big
basket with stones. He went to the area near his farm and thought,
""If I throw down all the stones together, the water that comes will
surpass the waters of all my brothers."" He emptied the basket in one
spot, and water came from every side. It covered his farm and all the
land around it, and it threatened to overflow the whole earth. He and

Many other orishas lived with Olorun in the sky, including Ifa, also known as Orunmila, the deity of divination; Eshu, the orisha of chance and master of languages; and Obatala, Olorun's second son. Obatala, looking down on Olukun's domain, saw a watery monotony and decided to make solid land in the sea. He proposed the idea to Olorun, who approved of it, and then went to Orunmila, who divined how it might be accomplished. Following Orunmila's instructions, Obatala had a gold chain made. He hooked it to the edge of the sky and climbed down, taking with him a snail shell full of sand, a white hen, a black cat, and a palm nut. There had not been enough gold in the sky to make a chain long enough to reach the sea. Obatala clung to the end of it and could go no further. From above, Orunmila yelled, ""the sand. "" Obatala poured out the sand from the snail shell. Orunmila said, ""The hen. "" Obatala released the hen. It scratched at the sand and scattered it in all directions, creating dry land. Since it was scattered unevenly, it formed hills and valleys. Obatala let go and dropped to the newly created earth. He named the place he landed Ife. He built a house there, planted a palm tree, and lived there with his cat. After some time, Olorun sent his servent Agemo, the chameleon, down the gold chain to check how things were with Obatala. Obatala sent word back that the world was too gray, so Olorun created the sun and set it moving. Later, Obatala decided to make people for company. He sculpted many from clay, but he became tired and thirsty in the process, so he stopped to make palm wine. He drank much wine and went back to work, but because he had drunk so much, some of the figures were misshapen. Obatala called on Olorun to put the breath of life into the figures, which he did, and the people came to life and built a city around Obatala's house. When the effects of the wine wore off, Obatala saw the misshapen people and felt remorse. He resolved to abstain from drinking in the future and to be the special protector of deformed people. Obatala gave the people tools, and they began farming and procreating. Obatala ruled them for awhile, but he became lonesome for the sky and returned there.

When they brought him a sacrifice, he went and informed Obatala what was happening. Obatala did not know how to deal with Olokun, so he consulted the diviner Orunmila. Orunmila consulted his divining nuts and determined to handle the problem himself. He went to earth and, with his powers, weakened Olokun's waves and dried the land. At the people's request, he stayed on earth awhile and taught certain men the arts of divining, or how to ascertain the wishes and intentions of the Sky God Olorun. Earthly order progressed.

always to protect humans, and Obatala himself returned to visit from
time to time.Olokun, orisha of the sea, was angered and humiliated by the
encroachment on her domain. So one time while Obatala rested in the
sky, she sent waves against the shores of the land, flooding low
areas, causing marshes, destroying fields, and drowning many people.
All of Obatala's work was threatened with destruction. The people
called to Obatala for help, but he could not hear them, so they went
to the orisha Eshu, who lived on earth then, and asked him to carry
the message to Obatala.Eshu refused to move until they brought him a proper sacrifice.
They sacrificed a goat for Obatala, but he told them that the
messenger on a long journey deserves a gift too. When they brought
him a sacrifice, he went and informed Obatala what was happening.Obatala did not know how to deal with Olokun, so he consulted the
diviner Orunmila. Orunmila consulted his divining nuts and determined
to handle the problem himself. He went to earth and, with his powers,
weakened Olokun's waves and dried the land. At the people's request,
he stayed on earth awhile and taught certain men the arts of divining,
or how to ascertain the wishes and intentions of the Sky God Olorun.
Earthly order progressed.Olokun was still upset and sought a way to humiliate the sky god.
She challenged Olorun to a contest of clothmaking, at which she
excelled. Olorun sent Agemo, the chameleon, as a messenger, asking
Olokun first to show some of her cloth. Each fabric she showed, Agemo
duplicated exactly on his skin. Seeing such a power in a mere
messenger, Olokun wondered at Olorun's powers and acknowledged his
greatness.","At the beginning of time, there was only the sky, ruled over by the orisha, or god, Olorun, and the waters below, ruled by the female deity Olokun. Many other orishas lived with Olorun in the sky, including Ifa, also known as Orunmila, the deity of divination; Eshu, the orisha of chance and master of languages; and Obatala, Olorun's second son. Obatala, looking down on Olukun's domain, saw a watery monotony and decided to make solid land in the sea. He proposed the idea to Olorun, who approved of it, and then went to Orunmila, who divined how it might be accomplished. Following Orunmila's instructions, Obatala had a gold chain made. He hooked it to the edge of the sky and climbed down, taking with him a snail shell full of sand, a white hen, a black cat, and a palm nut. There had not been enough gold in the sky to make a chain long enough to reach the sea. Obatala clung to the end of it and could go no further. From above, Orunmila yelled, ""the sand. "" Obatala poured out the sand from the snail shell. Orunmila said, ""The hen. "" Obatala released the hen. It scratched at the sand and scattered it in all directions, creating dry land. Since it was scattered unevenly, it formed hills and valleys. Obatala let go and dropped to the newly created earth. He named the place he landed Ife. He built a house there, planted a palm tree, and lived there with his cat. After some time, Olorun sent his servent Agemo, the chameleon, down the gold chain to check how things were with Obatala. Obatala sent word back that the world was too gray, so Olorun created the sun and set it moving. Later, Obatala decided to make people for company. He sculpted many from clay, but he became tired and thirsty in the process, so he stopped to make palm wine. He drank much wine and went back to work, but because he had drunk so much, some of the figures were misshapen. Obatala called on Olorun to put the breath of life into the figures, which he did, and the people came to life and built a city around Obatala's house. When the effects of the wine wore off, Obatala saw the misshapen people and felt remorse. He resolved to abstain from drinking in the future and to be the special protector of deformed people. Obatala gave the people tools, and they began farming and procreating. Obatala ruled them for awhile, but he became lonesome for the sky and returned there.

The wells failed, the crops failed, people suffered and died. The Oba, or ruler, of the city sent for babalawos, diviners, to come and explain what was the reason for the drought and how to end it. The babalawos came and performed their divinations, but there advice had no effect. After many months, a babalawo named O came from a distant city. He cast his divinations and told the Oba, ""This drought has been sent because the people of this city have neglected their sacrifices to the orishas, and the orishas are dispeased. To appease them, you must make a sacrifice of seven cola nuts, seven peppers, seven bush rats, and seven fish, and seven of every other edible things.

However, the only stranger in town was the babalawo. Though he had misgivings, the Oba saw no alternative, so he ordered his soldiers to be ready to sacrifice O when he gave the signal. As O was preparing the offering, he asked where the stranger's blood was. ""Don't worry, it will come in time,"" was the only answer he received. O, understanding the situation, decided that if he was to be killed, at least the city would not benefit from it, so he withheld the cola nuts from the offering, hiding them under the soil.

He ordered his men to check O's body, and he wondered with fear when they reported back, ""O ra,"" meaning ""O's body has not decayed. "" For seven days they checked, and each day the report was ""O ra,"" which reached the ears of everyone in the city.

Conducting him through Perfeddwlad, he treacherously stabbed him and took his collar, covering the murder with the story that they had been set upon by robbers, headed by an outlaw noble, whom he had slain in fair fight. Gwendud now agreed to wed Tathal, and Helig made a great feast for the families of the couple. A harper who had been summoned to entertain at the revel had the gift of second sight. He asked a cupbearer to notify him if he saw anything unusual in the cellar when he went to draw the mead. It was not long before the cupbearer came running to the harper saying that water was flowing into the cellar, with fishes swimming in it. The harper recognized this as a sign of the coming vengeance, and he and the servant fled for their lives. They were hardly out of the banquet hall when they heard the roar of a great flood behind them, followed by shrieks of terror. They ran as hard as they could, barely ahead of the pursuing waves, until they reached Rhiwgyfylchi and safety. When the sun rose in the morning, they saw an expanse of water where Tyno Helig once was. Some say the ruins of Helig's palace can be seen in the depths when the water is calm.","Many years ago, Helig ab Glannach ruled over a fertile tract of land
