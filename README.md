# Mapping Flood Myths

Mapping Flood Myths is a project that looks at flood myths, stories and legends from all over the world by mapping the locations of these myths on an interactive web map.

This project was created as a capstone project by [Ashley Rojas](https://github.com/arojas1/) to fulfill the Masters Degree requirements for the Digital Humanities program at The Graduate Center, CUNY.

Specifications and details on the project can be found in the whitepaper: LINK COMING SOON.
