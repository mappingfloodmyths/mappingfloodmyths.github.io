    <h2>About the Data</h2>
    <p>Currently, the data from this website was collected from <a href="https://www.curioustaxonomy.net/home/FloodMyths/" target="_blank"><i>The Flood in World Myth and Folklore</i></a> by Mark Isaak. He has the most comprehensive list of flood myths I have been able to find.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One thing to note about the flood myths is that they have been collected from many places. This site is not meant to be a definitive collection of myths. Some of the stories here may be different versions from what is believed by its respective peoples or contested accounts. My goal was to be able to map any mention of flood myths, including those that may have alternate versions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you know of any flood myths that are not included in this database, or have alternate versions, please feel free to contact me via the <a id="contact" onclick="activelink(this.id)">Contact</a> tab.</p>
