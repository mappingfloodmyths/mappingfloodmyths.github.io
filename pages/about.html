    <h2>What is the Mapping Flood Myths project?</h2>
    <p>Mapping Flood Myths is a project that looks at flood myths and legends created by pre-scientific cultures by mapping the locations of these myths on an interactive web map.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why was the project created?</h2>
    <p>Water, as the source of all life, has the power to create and destroy. Floods, prior to modern meteorology, would have been seen as acts of the divine, leading to the creation of flood myths, stories, and legends from many civilizations. The power of water transcends time and connects all of humankind. Present day examples include hurricanes (in the United States those such as Katrina, Maria, and Irene to name a few) and tsunamis (in Japan such as Fukushima).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
    <p>A majority of the current flood myth analyses have targeted Euro-Centric civilizations (ex: Noah’s Arc/Christianity, Gilgamesh’s flood/Babylon, and Deucalion’s flood/Greek). This project can allow for flood myths from other civilizations to be discovered and further researched.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With the inclusion of flood myths from all over the world, this project can be a starting point for further analysis of the importance of flood myths and how they shaped civilizations, as well as new analyses within the fields of geomythology, archaeology, meteorology, and many more. Future additions to this project can include change in the myths over time (either by where they are originating from or the contents of the myths), any geological/archaeological evidence that may support the myths, or meteorological discoveries that can help predict or understand our current and future climate.</p>

    <h2>Who created Mapping Flood Myths?</h2>
    <p>My name is Ashley Rojas and I am a student at The Graduate Center, CUNY. I created Mapping Flood Myths as my capstone for the master's program for Digital Humanities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I received my bachelor’s degree in Classical Archaeology and Classical Studies, with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in the relationships between cultures that can be found in their artefacts or stories. Whether directly influenced by one another or not, the similarities between different civilizations are fascinating. One such similarity is the creation of flood myths. As a visual learner, I wanted to be able to map the locations of such flood myths to see what connections may arise from where or when they were created. This project is a start to learning more about these connections and research into how these myths started.</p>

    <h2>Where is the data from?</h2>
    <p>All of the data at this time was collected from <a href="https://www.curioustaxonomy.net/home/FloodMyths/" target="_blank">“The Flood in World Myth and Folklore”</a> by Mark Isaak. More information on the data can be found on the <a id="data" onclick="activelink(this.id)">Data</a> tab.</p>
